## Articles

### Abbreviations \[Articles\]

#### Acronyms

***Acronyms*** (which are read as words) tend not to require preceding articles at all except when they are used adjectivally[^adjectivally]:

> *The patient was diagnosed with AIDS.*

> *UNESCO designates World Heritage Sites.*

> *Finland is not a member of NATO.*

> ***The** AIDS <ins>patient</ins>*

> *The Giza pyramids are **a** UNESCO <ins>World Heritage Site</ins>.*

> ***The** UNICEF <ins>campaign</ins> raised awareness.*

#### Initialisms

***Initialisms*** (which are pronounced as individual letters) tend to use a preceding article (whether definite or indefinite):

> ***a** CD*

> ***an** NGO*

> ***the** EU*

> *He has a new job at **the** BBC.*

> ***The** UN was voting later that day.*

> ***An** FBI agent has infiltrated the group.*

> ***The** DVD player is broken.*

However, when you use an initialism as a noun that names a condition or illness, a substance, or a method of doing something, you do not usually need an article:

> *DDT[^ddt] has been banned for many years.*

> *Too much typing has given me RSI[^rsi].*

> *The course teaches you how to use CPR[^cpr].*

#### Pronunciation

| Sound type | Article | Example |

## Commas

### Furthermore, however, moreover, therefore \[Commas\]

1. At the beginning of a sentence: put a comma after these words (some modern writers are now dropping the comma).

   > ***Therefore**, we will proceed with the order.*

   > ***However**, we still have hope.*

   1.1. A traditional rule stated that ***however*** meaning *nevertheless* should not be used at the beginning of a sentence. Most style guides consider this rule old-fashioned.

2. Use a semicolon and comma to introduce a new independent clause (a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.)

   > *She always meets her deadlines; **furthermore**, her work is good.*

   > *We plan to stay for another year; **however**, Peter is leaving now.*

   2.1. Some writers are now treating *however, therefore, moreover* and *furthermore* as conjunctions and just using a comma:
   
     > *We plan to stay for another year, **however** Peter is leaving now.*

   2.2. You can also use ***however*** as a conjunction to mean *by whatever means*:
   
     > *I don’t care **however** you do it, just get it done.*

3. As intensifiers or for emphasis:

   > *You can, **therefore**, do whatever you like.*

   > *The vegetables, **furthermore**, are good for you.*

### But \[Commas\]

| Comma position | Put in a comma | Case explanation | Example |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Before | \+ | *But* connects two independent clauses[^independent_clause]. | *The rules aren’t written down anywhere, **but** the important rules rarely are.* |
|        |    |                                                              | *I have a gym membership, **but** I rarely use it.* |
|        |    |                                                              | *I want to go to Italy this year, **but** my kinds want to go to Greece.* |
|        | \- | *But* connects an independent clause with a dependent clause. | *You had a birthday party **but** didn’t tell me about it?* |
|        |    |                                                               | *You left me with nothing **but** a broken promise.* |
| After  | \+ | You’re interrupting the sentence flow with another word or clause immediately after *but*, to create emphasis. | *I enjoyed the book, **but**, to be honest, I didn’t completely understand it.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | ***But**, as you know, the dodo bird went extinct long ago.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | *I tried to go to the grocery store, **but**, as it turns out, it closed early.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | ***But**, my dear, you didn’t tell me the whole story.* |

[^independent_clause]: An independent clause is a string of words that can stand on its own as a complete sentence, with a subject and an object.

***

### Otherwise \[Commas\]

#### Conjunction (connector of clauses)

> *He couldn’t see her; **otherwise**, he would have to tell her the truth.* (~~, otherwise,~~: two independent clauses are connected. Always place a comma after *otherwise* here.[^otherwise])

[^otherwise]: Some sources allow *, otherwise, * or *Otherwise∅*

> He couldn’t see her. Otherwise, he would have to tell her the truth.

We can use <ins>;</ins> or <ins>.</ins> interchangeably. Many people use <ins>;</ins> when they want the sentence to continue a little longer, while <ins>.</ins> are useful for breaking up sentences or long bodies of text.

#### Part of a parenthetical element[^parenthetical]

[^parenthetical]: Parenthetical element = поясняющая конструкция

> *My job, **otherwise** known as hell on earth, is causing me to have a lot of issues.*

> *You shouldn’t have said that to Mr. Hampshire, **otherwise** known as Paul.*

#### Adjective

Many people avoid using this old-fashioned structure today because it’s not too particular with its meaning.

> *This **otherwise** delicious piece of fruit isn’t something I’ve ever thought of trying myself.*

> *An **otherwise** pleasure had become a grinding chore.*

> *I couldn’t have said it better **otherwise**.*

> *There will be no surprises – pleasant or **otherwise**.*

### Such as \[Commas\]

| Type of a phrase | Comma before *such as* | Example | Explanation |
|------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Restrictive | \- | *Bands **such as** The Who and Deep Purple are known for playing loud.* | *such as* cannot be omitted |
| Non-restrictive | \+ | *I’m a big fan of frozen desserts, **such as** popsicles and ice cream.* | *such as* can be omitted: \= *I’m a big fan of frozen desserts.* |

## Formatting Punctuation Marks

### Italicizing Comma After an Italic Word

If the commas are not logically part of the italicized material, they should not be italicized.

> We rented the movie *Planes, Trains and Automobiles*. \[The comma is part of the title\]

### Punctuation Mark and a Word Before

The formatting of the punctuation mark should match the formatting of the word before, but there can be exceptions:

> The difference is statistically significant (*p* < .05).

### Colon at the End of a Heading

Do not underline the colon at the end of a heading.

## Capitalization

### Tables \[Capitalization\]

\[Microsoft Style Guide\]

Use sentence-style capitalization for:
- the table title;
- each column header;
- the text in cells unless there’s a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be lowercase).

| Tables are sometimes useful for	| Example |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| Data or values | Text formats and their associated HTML codes |
| Simple instructions | User interface actions and their associated keyboard shortcuts |
| Categories of things with examples | SKUs[^SKU] and the products they include |
| Collections of things with two or more attributes | Event dates with times and locations |

[^SKU]: Stock Keeping Unit = артикул (код товара)

[*Source*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/tables)

***

### Table of Contents \[Capitalization\]

If you use a certain capitalization in the title of a chapter, then use the same capitalization whenever you mention that title elsewhere, including within the Table of Contents.

### To \[Capitalization\]

Capitalize ***to*** if:
- it is the first word of the title:
  > ***To** Infinity and Beyond*
- it is used as an adverb (*to and fro*, *come to*, *pull to*):
  > *Walking **To** <ins>and Fro</ins>*
  
  > *<ins>Pull</ins> the Door **To** and Lock It*

- it is the last word of the title \[depends on a style guide\]:
  > *Music That You Can Dance **To***

Do not capitalize ***to*** in all other cases:
- *Back *to* the 50s* \[preposition, all style guides\]
- *You Don’t Have **to** Tell Me* \[infinitive, depends on a style guide\]

## Singular or plural

### None \[Singular or plural\]

| Role | Example | Explanation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Plural noun | ***None** of the movies **are** worth watching.* | *movies* is plural |
| Singular noun | ***None** of your advice **is** helpful.* | *advice* is singular |
| Plural pronoun | ***None** of my friends **are** going to the fair.* | *none* could be substituted with *not any* |
| Singular pronoun | *She ate it all, and now **none is** left.* | *none* could be substituted with *nothing* |
| Adverb | *We’ll take it while he’s not looking, and he’ll **be none** the wiser.* | *none* is modifying the verb *be* and effectively means *not at all* |

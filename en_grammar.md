[otherwise](#otherwise)

## otherwise

### Conjunction (connector of clauses)

> *He couldn’t see her; **otherwise**, he would have to tell her the truth.* (~~, otherwise,~~: two independent clauses are connected. Always place a comma after *otherwise* here.[^otherwise])

[^otherwise]: Some sources allow *, otherwise, * or *Otherwise∅*

> He couldn’t see her. Otherwise, he would have to tell her the truth.

We can use <ins>;</ins> or <ins>.</ins> interchangeably. Many people use <ins>;</ins> when they want the sentence to continue a little longer, while <ins>.</ins> are useful for breaking up sentences or long bodies of text.

### Part of a parenthetical element[^parenthetical]

[^parenthetical]: Parenthetical element = поясняющая конструкция

> *My job, **otherwise** known as hell on earth, is causing me to have a lot of issues.*

> *You shouldn’t have said that to Mr. Hampshire, **otherwise** known as Paul.*

### Adjective

Many people avoid using this old-fashioned structure today because it’s not too particular with its meaning.

> *This **otherwise** delicious piece of fruit isn’t something I’ve ever thought of trying myself.*

> *An **otherwise** pleasure had become a grinding chore.*

> *I couldn’t have said it better **otherwise**.*

> *There will be no surprises – pleasant or **otherwise**.*

## Capitalization

### TOC

If you use a certain capitalization in the title of a chapter, then use the same capitalization whenever you mention that title elsewhere, including within the Table of Contents.

### To

Capitalize ***to*** if:
- it is the first word of the title:
  > ***To** Infinity and Beyond*
- it is used as an adverb (*to and fro*, *come to*, *pull to*):
  > *Walking **To** <ins>and Fro</ins>*
  > *<ins>Pull</ins> the Door **To** and Lock It*
- it is the last word of the title \[depends on a style guide\]:
  > *Music That You Can Dance **To***

Do not capitalize ***to*** in all other cases:
- *Back *to* the 50s* \[preposition, all style guides\]
- *You Don’t Have **to** Tell Me* \[infinitive, depends on a style guide\]

According to the AP rules (but not AMA, APA, Bluebook, Chicago, MLA, New York Times, Wikipedia), *to* is capitalized when it is part of an infinitive.

## None (singular or plural)

| Role | Example | Explanation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Plural noun | ***None** of the movies **are** worth watching.* | *movies* is plural |
| Singular noun | ***None** of your advice **is** helpful.* | *advice* is singular |
| Plural pronoun | ***None** of my friends **are** going to the fair.* | *none* could be substituted with *not any* |
| Singular pronoun | *She ate it all, and now **none is** left.* | *none* could be substituted with *nothing* |
| Adverb | *We’ll take it while he’s not looking, and he’ll **be none** the wiser.* | *none* is modifying the verb *be* and effectively means *not at all* |

## Otherwise

### Conjunction (connector of clauses)

> *He couldn’t see her; **otherwise**, he would have to tell her the truth.* (~~, otherwise,~~: two independent clauses are connected. Always place a comma after *otherwise* here.[^otherwise])

[^otherwise]: Some sources allow *, otherwise, * or *Otherwise∅*

> He couldn’t see her. Otherwise, he would have to tell her the truth.

We can use <ins>;</ins> or <ins>.</ins> interchangeably. Many people use <ins>;</ins> when they want the sentence to continue a little longer, while <ins>.</ins> are useful for breaking up sentences or long bodies of text.

### Part of a parenthetical element[^parenthetical]

[^parenthetical]: Parenthetical element = поясняющая конструкция

> *My job, **otherwise** known as hell on earth, is causing me to have a lot of issues.*

> *You shouldn’t have said that to Mr. Hampshire, **otherwise** known as Paul.*

### Adjective

Many people avoid using this old-fashioned structure today because it’s not too particular with its meaning.

> *This **otherwise** delicious piece of fruit isn’t something I’ve ever thought of trying myself.*

> *An **otherwise** pleasure had become a grinding chore.*

> *I couldn’t have said it better **otherwise**.*

> *There will be no surprises – pleasant or **otherwise**.*

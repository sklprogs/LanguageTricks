## able to \| capable of

If someone is **able to** do something, they can do it and it is not
unusual or surprising if they do it:

> *The doctor said that after a few years I\'d be **able to** get out of bed.*

> *Will you be **able to** play on Saturday?*

If someone is **capable of** (doing) something, they do not usually
do it, but it is possible for them to do it if they want to:

> *I\'m sure he\'s quite **capable of** getting here on time, but he can\'t be bothered.*

> *The power station is **capable of** generating enough electricity for the whole region.*

**capable of** is also used when talking about machines and technical
equipment:

> *\...water turbines, which are **capable of** producing more economical electricity.*

[*Source*](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/capable-of-and-able-to.249028/)

***

## made from \| made of

**Made of** is used when the material the subject consists of doesn\'t
change during the process of making the subject.

> *Chairs are **made of** wood.*

Here, wood is still wood. It doesn\'t transform into something else.

On the other hand, **made from** is used when the material changed its nature.

> *Paper is **made from** wood.*

Now, wood disappeared --- it was transformed into paper.

Some more examples:

> *The house is **made of** bricks.* \[They are still bricks.\]

> *Wine is **made from** grapes.* \[Grapes turn into wine.\]

> *I have a table and it\'s **made from** bamboo.*

The carpenter took stocks of bamboo, cut them, halved them, and made
them into a table. The carpenter **modified** the bamboo\'s
**structural integrity**, so my table is **made from** bamboo.

> *I have a vase and it\'s made of bamboo.*

The carpenter took a stock of bamboo and carved a vase out of it. The
carpenter **didn\'t modify** the bamboo\'s **structural integrity**, so
my vase is **made of** bamboo.

## during \| within

**during** indicates a time frame

**within** implies a limit or deadline

This came up recently in the following sentence:

> *\... the new office will support the beneficiary \... **within**
> one year of petitioner approval.*

The business had interpreted that as *during the year of*, and it got
them into a bit of trouble. They supported the beneficiary for a year
but were not able to continue to support him after. The intent was
for the position to continue, not end.

## new \| novel

**novel** = innovative

***

## compare to \| compare with

**to**: акцент делается на схожести сравниваемых вещей

**with**: акцент делается на разности вещей больше, чем на их схожести

[*Source*](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/compared-to-or-compared-with/)

***

## content \| contents

-   **content:** the entirety of information contained in something. The
    story of a novel or the subject of an illustration can be called
    their "content". Just like "information", content is always
    uncountable when used in this sense. The word is most commonly used
    in reference to the content of a website, as in,

>> *Most websites contain mostly ads with very little content.*

-   **content/contents**: the amount of a substance contained in
    something else. It may be either countable or uncountable. We can
    speak of "salt content" or "fat content" in foods, "alcohol content"
    in drinks, and so on, e.g.

>> *Bacon has (a) very high salt content.*

-   **contents:** things contained in something:

    -   In a concrete sense. We can speak of the "contents of a bag",
        "contents of a bottle", "contents of the stomach", etc., for
        instance,

    >> *He dropped a bottle and spilled its contents all over the floor.*

    -   In an abstract sense. Traditionally, pieces of information
        contained in a written document are called its "contents". You
        may say,

    >> *She has lost the letter and remained unaware of its contents.*

Using the singular **content** in this case is becoming increasingly more
common but is still considered wrong by many. The distinction is rather
subtle; if you consider the contents of a document to be separate pieces
of information, you should use **contents** (which is usually the case
with a letter). If you refer to them as a whole, you should use
**content**---it makes more sense to say that *the book contains violent
content* than *the book contains violent contents*.

***

## borehole \| well

Typically a borehole is drilled by machine and is relatively small in
diameter. A well is usually sunk by hand and is relatively large in
diameter.

[*Source*](https://www.welldrillers.org/faq/about-boreholes-and-wells/)

***

## boring \| drilling

**Drilling** is *the cutting process* of a material using a specially
designed rotating cutting tool called a drill bit. The holes produced by
the drilling are always cylindrical in shape and circular in the
diameter.

**Boring** is *the process of enlarging a hole that is already in the
material*; it may be a hole made by drilling or in the casting. Boring
concerns the internal diameter and the surface of the hole rather than
the depth of the hole. In this sense, it can be considered as a twin
process of turning, where the outer diameter and the surface are the
concerns. Boring is done using a boring bar, which is a heavy metal bar
with the tools fixed at the end.

[*Source*](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-drilling-and-vs-boring/)

***

## particular \| specific

As *adjectives* the difference between specific and particular is that
**specific** is explicit or definite while **particular** is (obsolete)
pertaining only to a part of something; partial.

As *nouns* the difference between specific and particular is that
**specific** is a distinguishing attribute or quality while **particular**
is a small individual part of something larger; a detail, a point.

[*Source*](https://wikidiff.com/specific/particular)

***

## part of \| a part of

Generally, you can use either.

If you say *Money is **part** of the American Dream*, you mean that both
ideas are strongly linked together. If you said *Money is **a part** of the
American Dream*, it would mean that money is only a part of the
American Dream. You would focus on just one part as opposed to the rest.
The second solution is grammatically correct but seems awkward as it
would be difficult to find a context in which it fits.

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/158232/difference-between-part-and-a-part)

***

## explanation for \| explanation of \| explanation to

you could use any of those three. The one I would hear most often in Geometry class would be with **of**.

[*Source*](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/it-provides-an-explanation-¿to-for-of-the-problem.226037/)

***

## can be further \| can further be

**can further be** -- pragmatically marked Furthermore (/In addition)

**can be further** -- underlining what goes afterwards

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/414029/can-further-be-vs-can-be-further)

***

## consist in \| consist of

**consist of**: to be made up of, comprise

> *This novel **consists of** three parts.*

> *Genes **consist of** a specific sequence of DNA.*

**consist in**: Be essential, be inherent or lie in

> *His social success **consists in** making people believe
he is interested in what they say.*

The secret to a successful relationship consists in knowing that a
crisis doesn't mean everything is over.

Some people say a key point to know which one to use is that **consist
of** is normally used with more tangible objects whereas **consist
in** refers to an abstract quality.

Others also say that **consist of** is always followed by a noun
phrase, whereas **consist in** is followed by a verb.

[*Source*](http://ourenglishblog.com/grammar/consist-of-or-consist-in/)

***

## effective \| efficient

**effective** focuses on whether or not something is accomplished. It
doesn't focus on how something is done, but rather, if it is done at
all.

> *We need an **effective** solution for everyone.*

**efficient** focuses on how something is done: acting or producing
effectively with minimum waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.

> *My new car is very fuel-**efficient**, and it gets 40 miles per gallon*

[*Source*](https://writingexplained.org/effective-vs-efficient-difference)

***

## efficacy \| efficiency

**efficacy**: the power or capacity to produce a desired effect; widely
used, among other places, in the medical field

> *There is in still limited information on the **efficacy** of this cancer
treatment.*

**efficiency**: the quality or property of being efficient

[*Source*](https://writingexplained.org/efficacy-vs-efficiency-difference)

***

## data (singular \| plural)

When data is a count noun (items that can be counted), the plural makes
sense.

> *The data used were out of date.*

In that type of sentence, you could replace data with another count noun
such as 'facts'.

However, when data is treated as a non-count noun (items cannot be
counted), the singular makes sense.

> *The data used was out of date.*

With that type of sentence, you could replace data with a word such as
*information*.

[*Source*](https://www.onlinegrammar.com.au/top-10-grammar-myths-data-is-plural-so-must-take-a-plural-verb/)

***

## usage \| use

In general when thinking about how these words are different it is
helpful to keep in mind that the term "*usage*" refers to conventions or
patterns and often refers to language or words and how they are used,
accepted, and understood. The word "*use*" has a much broader meaning
and is found in more contexts. In my opinion, when in doubt, use the
word "use."

[*Source*](https://blogs.transparent.com/english/use-versus-usage/)

***

## complement \| supplement

-   **Supplement** would refer to extra/additional information.
    **Complement** refers to an item that completes or goes well with
    another item.
-   A **complement** usually makes the word that it goes with complete
    or perfect. A **supplement**, however, only helps that word. It is
    purely supplementary.

Generally, a **complement** is always the response to incompleteness
that provides the required essential part. For example: *Soul is the
complement for a human body to become a human being* (without soul the
body is not human being).

-   A **supplement** is always the response to extra needs or demand.
    For example: *Spare Tyre is the supplement for any vehicle* (without
    the spare tyre it's possible to go anywhere but it's essential to
    have one)

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/26129/complement-or-supplement)

***

## dosage \| dose

**Dose** is the amount or quantity of medicine to be taken or
administered to the patient every time in a day. If it is 5mg, then 5mg
is the dose to be given to the patient.

**Dosage** implies *the duration or the frequency* of the dose to be
administered.

[*Source*](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-dose-and-vs-dosage/)

***

## dependence \| dependency

I think *dependence* and *dependency* are like *competence* and
*competency*. Both are nouns. Yet, **dependence** emphasizes the quality
of being dependent. So, it may also be abstract. Whereas, **dependency**
focuses on the state of being dependent. It is likely to be concrete.

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/57080/dependence-vs-dependency)

***

## enhance \| improve

**enhance** is to add something (more functionality, more ability, more
option).

**improve** is to make the something better -- no additions, just
improvement of what was already there.

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/105465/what-differences-are-there-between-to-enhance-and-to-improve)

***

## shameful \| shameless

**Shameless** means pretty much what you\'d expect: that someone should
feel shame at something, but doesn\'t.

**Shameful** can have two meanings that almost seem like antonyms, but
they\'re not, depending on whether it\'s applied to a person or an act.
If it\'s applied to a person, it generally means that they feel remorse.
If it\'s applied to an act, it means that whoever is performing the
action should feel shame. However, it\'s often used to emphasize that
the person *should* feel shame, but *doesn\'t*. In this latter sense, it
can almost seem like "shameful" means the same thing as "shameless".

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/37622/shameful-vs-shameless)

***

## due to \| owing to

If you can use **caused by** then you can also use **due to**:

> *The cancellation of the flight was **due to*** (caused by) *high winds.*

If you can use **because of** then you should use **owing to** rather
than *due to* (or leave it as *because of*):

> *The flight was cancelled **owing to*** (because of) *high winds.*

***

## disperse \| dissolve

A **solution** is a mixture of one substance *dissolved* in another
substance. It has a solute and a solvent.

A **dispersion** is a mixture of one substance *phase separated* from
another substance. They phase separate because they *do not* dissolve
with each other.

## лекарственное средство \| лекарственный препарат

1.  Лекарственное средство представлено в виде каких-то пищевых добавок,

2.  В странах Европы считается, что лекарственное средство -- это часть

3.  В современной медицине предпочтение отдаётся лекарственным

## compose \| comprise \| contain

Comprise is a synonym of contain. As verbs the difference between
comprise and contain is that **comprise** is to be made up of; to
consist of (especially a comprehensive list of parts) while
**contain** is (transitive): to hold inside.

**Comprise** says that the list you are giving is exhaustive. All the
steps are explicitly indicated, and there are no missing steps.
**Contain** does not guarantee either of these.

Don\'t say ~~*the method is comprised of X*~~.

You can say:

> *the method **comprises** X.*

or

> *the method **consists of** X.*


**Compose of** is even more formal than *consist of* and *comprise*.
**Compose of** is only used in the passive voice:

> *Muscle is **composed of** different types of protein.*

*Sources:
[1](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/contain-or-comprise.3023986/),
[2](https://wikidiff.com/comprise/contain),
[3](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/consist-comprise-or-compose)*

***

## contain \| include

**Contains** is used when there is something else that is doing the
containing. The box is a container, and contains the hats. You would
not, generally, say that the box includes the hats. Inside the box is a
set of objects, and that set (which \'contents\' refers to) includes
(and consists of) the hats.

**Includes** is also often used when talking about the features of a
product or thing for sale. If I were selling you the box, I might tell
you that it includes three hats. In this case, I\'m not pointing out
that the hats are inside the box, but rather that the box and the hats
are all part of the set of things I\'m offering to sell.

***

## additional \| extra

**Additional** means a number has been added to the basic number.

**Extra** often means beyond what is necessary or needed. Additional
room may be needed; extra room may never be used. Compare these to
"spare". A spare tire or a spare room may never be used, but they have
the specific purpose of being available in an emergency. Often when
something is "extra" you get rid of it.

Definition of **extra**:

- Beyond what is due, usual, expected, or necessary; additional;
supernumerary; also, extraordinarily good; superior; as, extra work;
extra pay.

- Something in addition to what is due, expected, or customary;
something in addition to the regular charge or compensation, or for
which an additional charge is made; as, at European hotels lights are
extras.

## disturbance (plural)

The noun "disturbance" can be countable or uncountable. In more general,

colloquial (ordinary conversation, informal).

## accurate \| precise

**Accuracy** is close to a known value; **precision** measures
repeatability.

In the fields of science and engineering, the **accuracy** of a
measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a
quantity to that quantity\'s true value. The **precision** of a
measurement system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the
degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show
the same results. Although the two words precision and accuracy can be
synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the
context of the scientific method.

## data \| information

**Data** can be simple at the same time unorganized unless it is
organized. Data contains numbers, statements, and characters in a raw
form. **Information** is a set of data which is processed in a
meaningful way according to the given requirement. Information is
processed, structured, or presented in a given context to make it
meaningful and useful. So, when the data is transformed into
information, it never has any useless details.

## router (pronunciation)

A **router** (computer thing, from verb "route"), or anything else which
routes something, is "rooter" or "rowter" depending on how you pronounce
"route" (US English has both "root" and "rowt", British English has only
"root")

A **router** (woodworking tool, from verb "rout", an electrical one is
shown above) is "rowter", never "rooter", in both the US and the UK and
other countries.

## essentially \| substantially

**substantially** = considerably

**essentially** = in its essence

**Essentially** should be avoided at all costs unless you are trying
to convey the meaning of a "required" feature. Casual use of
"essentially" will mean ending up littering your translation with
necessary features, which once again has a significant impact on the
scope of protection. If in doubt, go with **substantially**.

## on \| onto

We use **onto** to talk about direction or movement to a position on a
surface, usually with a verb that expresses movement:

> *The cat climbed **onto** the roof.*

> *She emptied the suitcase full of clothes **onto** the floor.*

We use **onto** to describe movement towards an end position along a
road or river:

> *The path leads onto the main road.*

We use **on** or **onto** with very little difference in meaning to
refer to attachment or movement of something to something else. **Onto**
gives a stronger feeling of movement:

> *There's a battery pack with the camera that you can clip **onto** a belt.*

> *You can save the data **onto** your hard disk.*

> *Have you put the pictures **on** your memory stick?*

## company name

-   Unlike in Russian (JSC Rusal or whatever), the company type always
    follows the company name -- whether Corporation, Limited, or any
    other type.
-   We should not use the definite article before the firm or company
    unless the article is the part of the company\'s name.
-   If the word "company" is not part of the official name, then using
    the word "company" after the official name technically makes the
    official name an adjective that serves to qualify the real noun,
    which is the word "company". In this case, you need the definite
    article, as in "I like working for the Cool\_Dude.com company". I
    would rather say, "I like working for Cool\_Dude.com", but I can
    imagine some situations where I want to clarify that I am talking
    about a company.

## starting from \| starting with

> *Please give me all the names **starting with** A.*

**Starting with** A includes only words that start with the letter A.

**Starting from** A gives you all the words that start with A and all the
words that start with the letters after A.

> *Let\'s start cutting back on our expenses, **starting with/from** the money
we spend on food.*

They can be used interchangeably if there is no order to what is being
started with/from, though with is more correct in my opinion. When order
matters, **starting from** includes all items starting with and coming
after.

## translate into \| translate to

-   When you speak about the target language of translation, the usual
    preposition is **into**:

>> *She translated the text **into** German.*

-   When pointing out that one phrase is a translation of another, i.e.
    when the "target" is a phrase rather than a language, **to** is used
    instead:

>> *"Good morning!" was translated **to** "Guten Morgen!".*

-   Both variants are common for the pattern *from a language (in)to
    another language*:

>> *She translated the text from English **into** German.*

>> *She translated the text from English **to** German.* (also possible)

While the variant with **into** is more common in English literature (and
is also usually the the variant described in dictionaries and therefore
the more recommendable variant for non-native speakers), the variant
with **to** seems to be more common on the Internet and in everyday usage.

-   Note that when "language to language" is used as an adjective
    phrase, the situation is reversed, and only **to** is common:

>> *We need to prepare an English-**to**-French translation.*

## literature \| the literature

An article is not needed for a general use. When **literature** refers
to a specific collection of books, papers, etc., is related to a given
subject, we use **the**.

## before \| till \| until

If A happens before B, A happens and then B happens. If A happens
*until* B happens, A would happen, but stop when B happens. **Till** is a
shortened version of **until**.

> *I will leave home before sunrise at 04:15.*

> *I will not leave home till/until sunrise at 04:15.*

In the first example you leave the house any time up until 04:14 when it
is still dark.

In the second you leave no earlier than 04:15 when it starts to become
light.

Note the different constructions with positive and negative statements.

## opposite \| opposite to

-   As a noun, opposite may stand alone or be followed by the
    preposition of.

>> *Madeleine believes just the opposite!*

>> *What is the opposite of up?*

-   As an adjective, opposite may stand alone or be followed by the
    preposition to or occasionally from.

>> *The cars were travelling in opposite directions when the accident occurred.*

>> *Hyacinth's opinions are often opposite to Pierre's.*

>> *Keith's cottage is on the same lake but on the opposite side from (or to) ours.*

-   Opposite may also function as a preposition. The preposition
    opposite should not be followed by of or to.

>> *Jean-Luc lives in the house opposite ours.*

>> *Two dozen condos will be built opposite the theatre* (not ~~opposite of the
theatre~~ or ~~opposite to the theatre~~).

## residual \| residue \| residues

The noun **residue** can be countable or uncountable. In more general,
commonly used, contexts, the plural form will also be residue. However,
in more specific contexts, the plural form can also be **residues** e.g.
in reference to various types of residues or a collection of residues.

**Residual** is a derived term of residue. As nouns the difference
between residue and residual is that residue is whatever remains after
something else has been removed while residual is a remainder left over
at the end of some process.

## what \| which

If you are trying to make a choice, **what** is used to ask when there
is an unknown number or infinite possibilities for an answer.

**Which** is used if you are choosing between a more limited number of
items, already defined.

> *Which shoes should I wear with this dress?*

Often **which** or **what** can be used for several choices, depending on what
is in the speaker's mind:

*(a) "Which bus goes into the centre?"*

*(b) "What bus shall I take?"*

Both sentences are fine. The speaker is probably thinking about fewer
buses in sentence (a) than in sentence (b).

## drag \| lift \| thrust

Four Forces Affect Things That Fly:

**Weight** is the force of gravity. It acts in a downward direction --
toward the center of the Earth.

**Lift** is the force that acts at a right angle to the direction of
motion through the air. Lift is created by differences in air pressure.

**Thrust** is the force that propels a flying machine in the direction
of motion. Engines produce thrust.

**Drag** is the force that acts opposite to the direction of motion.
Drag is caused by friction and differences in air pressure.

**Anyone** is the singular version of the word and **anybody** is the

When **anyone** is used, it is typically to differentiate one person

This question seeks out any and all persons who can respond, any number
of people.

**Anybody** is sometimes considered inappropriate for formal
conversations, it is more appropriate for personal conversations.
**Anyone** is universally used in both formal and informal conversation
settings.

## independent of \| ~~independently from~~ \| independently of

**Independently from** is not correct usage, as well as being very
uncommon. From X would indicate either coming from X or going away from
X, neither of which applies here, since independence does not come or go
from something.

**Independent** is an adjective that defines a noun:

> *Something is independent of ...*

**Independently** is an adverb that defines a verb

> *You do something independently of ...*

The proper adverbial phrase is **independently of**. The phrase
**independent of**, an adjective phrase, is sometimes WRONGLY asked to

indicate only that the outcome itself is undetermined.

information that is a kind of summary about a subject i.e. a brochure

## in the photo \| in the picture \| on the postcard \| on the screen

If you are talking about the subject of the picture, use **in**:

> *The boy in the picture is smiling.*

> *The boy in the photograph is walking on the sand.*

It seems simply wrong to talk about a person, or an object, ~~on~~ the
photograph.

If you are talking about the picture as a piece of paper/canvas/etc.,
use **on**:

> *Spilling water on the picture will ruin it.*

It would be different talking about a postcard, because the
picture/photograph is, itself, on the postcard. So if the photograph of
the boy on the beach was printed as a postcard -- or a greeting card of
any kind -- then he would be the boy on the card.

> *The boy in the photograph on the card.*

Photo takes precedence over paper. We always speak of things in the
picture/in the photo, regardless of the medium (paper, digital image,
etc.) I would say *on the computer screen* because it is the medium for
displaying an image.

> *The boy in the image on the computer screen.*

If that image had been painted on canvas (or on a wall):

> *The boy in the picture and on the canvas (on the wall).*

## separated by \| separated with

**By** marks an agent phrase:

> *The fighters were finally separated by the referee.*

**With** marks an instrumental phrase:

> *The fighters were finally separated with a crowbar.*

When you\'re talking about metaphoric separation you have the option of
treating the "separator" either as an agent itself, or as a tool (of
another agent).

The agent interpretation:

> *The entries are separated by commas*

The instrument interpretation:

> *The entries were separated with commas*

*A typewriter* is an instrument, but *a ghostwriter* is a human, and
therefore an agent.

In most cases **by** and **with** are interchangeable, yet it could vary
in cases like:

> *I **smell with** my nose.*

> ~~*I smell by my nose.*~~

One of the interchangeable cases is:

> This is **indicated by** a green light.

> This is **indicated with** a green light.

If you are writing documentation for your application, use the correct
word for readability. For instance:

> *This should be **instantiated by** passing the arguments A, B and C.*

> *They should be **separated by** a comma.*

> *This should be **called with** D and E.*

A **wage** is the employee remuneration based on the number of hours

## answer \| reply \| response

**Response** is a very broad term, and includes all reactions to a
stimulus.

**Answer** is more specifically a response to a direct question.

One can always **respond** to anything (an event, an injury, a letter, a
speech, a question\...) but one can only **answer** a question. It\'s
possible to respond to a question without actually answering it; listen
to politicians being interviewed.

**Reply** normally refers to words or some other form of communication.
**Response** could be words or it could be actions. **Reply** is a
subset of **response**.

> *I asked for his name, and he **replied**, "Bob".*

> *I asked for his name, and he **responded**, "Bob".*

Someone can have a **response** to a stimulus, which might be a
**reply**:

> *James pricked Carol with a pin. Carol slapped James, **in reply**.*

The wince is a response, and not a reply:

> *James pricked Carol with a pin. Carol winced with pain.*

A **reply** has to go back to the source of the stimulus of the
response, e.g. a reply letter is written to someone who has written to
you. A **response** does not have to go back.

If the stimulus for your **response** did not come from an agent that
you have anthropomorphized, then it is not a **reply**. So you do not
get **replies** from machines, but you can get replies from companies.
You can get **responses** from both.

> *I am moving my mouse but the pointer is not **responding**.*

> *I switched the key in the ignition, but got no **response**.*

usage, regime commonly carries a negative connotation.) Far less often,
regime is used as a synonym for **regimen**.

The noun **regimen** primarily refers to a systematic plan, in
particular a regulated system of diet and exercise or a prescribed
course of medical treatment. Far less often, regimen is used as a
synonym for **regime** (a form of government), a usage that most
dictionaries identify as "rare" or "archaic."

The noun **regiment** primarily refers to a military unit or any large
group of people. (Though regiment was once regarded as a synonym for
**regime**, most dictionaries identify that usage as "archaic" or
"obsolete.") As a verb, regiment means to organize a group of people in
a systematic or oppressive manner.

## decrease \| reduce

**reduce** is to bring down the size, quantity, quality, value or
intensity of something; to diminish, to lower, to impair;

**decrease** is of a quantity, to become smaller

***

## gain \| profit

Profit and gain are two terms that should be distinguished correctly as
these have very different meanings in accounting.

**Profit** is the summation of total income less total expenses. It is
generated within the usual business operations. It is the actual
earnings of the company. This is an indication of the financial
robustness of the business.

**Gain** is the proceeds received from the sale of fixed or financial
assets. It is generated outside of business operations.

## sniffing \| snooping \| spoofing

**Sniffing** and **snooping** should be synonyms. They refer to
listening to a conversation. For example, if you login to a website that
uses no encryption, your username and password can be sniffed off the
network by someone who can capture the network traffic between you and
the web site.

**Spoofing** refers to actively introducing network traffic pretending
to be someone else. For example, spoofing is sending a command to
computer A pretending to be computer B. It is typically used in a
scenario where you generate network packets that say they originated by
computer B while they really originated by computer C.

**Spoofing** in an email context means sending an email pretending to be
someone else.

## class \| lesson

In both the UK and the US, **a class** is usually a group of students
who are learning together:

> *Jill and I were in the same class at primary school.*

You can also (especially in the US) use **class** to mean a group of
students who all completed their studies in a particular year:

> *Tim was in the class of 2005.*

**Class** can also mean a series of lessons in a particular subject:

> *She's taking a class in business administration.*

The usual British word for this is **course**:

> *a course in business administration*

**Class** can also mean one of the periods in the school day when a
group of students are taught:

> *What time is your next class?*

British speakers also use *lesson* for this meaning, but American speakers
do not.

## check if \| check whether

**If** and **whether** are often interchangeable, but sometimes using
one or the other will change the meaning of your sentence.

> *We want to know **if** you can come.*

> *We want to know **whether** you can come.*

> *Check his work and see **if** it is correct or not.*

> *Check his work and see **whether** it is correct or not.*

Use **if** when you have a conditional sentence and **whether** when
showing that two alternatives are possible.

There are two possibilities: Aardvark will arrive Friday, or Aardvark
will arrive Saturday:

> *Squiggly didn\'t know whether Aardvark would arrive Friday or
> Saturday.*

Aardvark may not arrive at all:

> *Squiggly didn\'t know if Aardvark would arrive Friday or Saturday.*

## subject \| topic

A **topic** is a particular subject that you discuss or write about.

A **topic** defines a particular aspect that will be covered in
conversation or in any written form, whereas **subject** is used in
context to a wider aspect of knowledge and can be composed of various
topics.

> *The subject of writing articles was the environmental issues, and
> various students came up with different topics on this particular
> subject matter.*

This is the reason that many times they are used interchangeably. They
only differ when the **subject** within the subject needs to be defined
and then the inner subject becomes the **topic**.

## check \| check that \| verify

To **check** means "to consult," or "to investigate."

**check**: to see if something (e.g., a machine) is in good condition or
working properly:

> *Have you checked the engine (over)?*

To see if something (e.g., a sum) is correct or accurate:

> *Will you check my addition?*

**Check that** means "make sure that".

**verify**: to confirm the truth or correctness of (something):

> *Can you verify her statement?*

**verify** implies a positive conclusion was reached, whereas **check**
just means something was investigated with no indication of the outcome.

## stop + -ing \| stop to + infinitive

We use the **-ing** form after stop to indicate that an action or event
is no longer continuing:

> *It's stopped raining. Let's go for a walk.*

We use the **to-infinitive** after stop to indicate that someone stops
doing something in order to do something else:

> *On the way to Edinburgh, we stopped to look at an old castle. (We were
> travelling, then we stopped our journey in order to look at the

## request \| require

**Request** = ask for

**Require** = need

> *I **require** (need) another cup of coffee. I will **request** (ask for)

forceful demand:

> *You are required to visit your local police station to produce your
> driving license.*

***

## big \| large

**Big** can refer to the physical size of an object, but it also means
that something is serious or important, while **large** only refers to
the physical size. They can only be used with countable nouns:

> *a **big** city*

> *a **large** company*

But not with uncountable nouns! Instead of saying ~~big traffic~~, say *a
lot of traffic.*

Use **big** in the following cases:

1. More than average (see **large** below):

>> *Our office is quite big.*

2. Very important:

>> *This is a big decision.*

3. Successful:

>> *Milan is a big fashion hub.*

4. Powerful:

>> *There was a big earthquake yesterday.*

5. Of a large degree:

>> *She is a big fan of that movie.*

>> *People of our generation are big social media users.*

6. Older (informal):

>> *Have you met my big brother yet?*

7. With fixed phrases:

    - big fish
    - big deal
    - The Big Apple
    - to think big, etc.

Use **large** in the following cases:

1.  More than average. Same meaning as **big**, but more formal:

>> *The town was quite large with lots of business buildings.*

2.  With quantity words:

    - a large area
    - a large volume
    - a large part of
    - to a large extent
    - a large amount
    - on a large scale
    - a large number of
    - a large quantity of
    - a large proportion
    - a large percentage of

3.  Body sizes. Following the convention, clothing sizes are Small (S),
    Medium (M) and Large (L). In very rare occasions will you see
    Big (B) instead. Calling someone \'fat\' or \'chubby\' does not
    sound nice to anyone\'s ears, so in most cases, it is better to
    leave it out and not mention it. However, if you really need to
    describe someone and you have to mention their \'largeness\', it
    sounds nicer to say **large** than anything else.

>> *Please, go talk to the chairman of the conference, he\'s super nice and
helpful. If you don\'t know him, he is the **large** man in the navy suit.*

4.  With fixed phrases:

    - At large:

        -   Free, not captured yet:

        >> *The police haven't caught the thief yet; he is still **at large**.*

        -   In general:

        >> *There has been a loss of community values in society **at large**.*

    - By and large (in general, overall):

        > ***By and large**, the company has been very good to me over the last
          couple of years.*

    - Larger than life:

        -   A person that attracts special attention because of their
            flamboyant appearance or behavior:

        >> *I've always thought that the marketing manager seemed **larger than life**.*

        - Something that seems disproportionately important:

        >> *Your problems always seem **larger than life** at that time of night.*

considered \| considered as
---------------------------

**considered as** construction is almost always redundant. If you use
**considered** to describe what people think of someone or something,
you simply don\'t need "as."

> *LeBron James is considered one of the best basketball players of all
> time.*

> *Bad grammar should be considered a crime.*

## comma use with if necessary \| if required \| when needed, etc.

At the start of a sentence, use a comma after **if necessary \| if
needed \| when required \| where needed** \| etc.

> *If necessary, I can stay up late to complete the work.*

Normally, you don't need a comma in mid-sentence or at the end of the
sentence:

> *I will help you if needed.*

However, use commas to set off these expressions if they interrupt the
sentence flow or provide an explanatory note:

> *Use disposable gloves, when required, before handling food.*

> *The British army needs women and men who are willing to fight for
> their country, if necessary.*

***

## affirm \| confirm

**Affirm**: to validate or state positively, to assert as valid and to
express someone's dedication. **Confirm**: to ratify, to strengthen, and
to give assurance.

**Confirm** is used for both negative and positive sentences; whereas
**affirm** is mainly positive.

> *The receptionist confirmed the hotel reservations.*

> *Serving in the defense services affirms your loyalty to the nation.*

## evaluation \| an evaluation

**An evaluation**: the talk is about a particular evaluation that has
been made:

> *This talk focuses on an evaluation of...*

**Evaluation**: the talk is about the process of evaluating:

> *This talk focuses on evaluation of...*

The talk itself is making an evaluation of something:

> *The focus of this talk is an evaluation of...*

Both the second and third sentences change the original meaning.

## временной \| временный

**Временный** значит непостоянный.

**Временной** --- относящийся ко времени, например временной интервал с
двух до пяти часов

***

## bound to \| bound with

**Bind to** is used to describe the action of tying or attaching an
object to another object:

> *Take the knife, and bind it to your leg.*

**Bind with** is used to describe the thing which is used to tie or
attach the object:

> *I will bind the knife with a rope.*

One is used with the object the action is performed upon, and the other
is used with the object performing the action.

There is a range of idiomatic uses and similar phrasal verbs.

The outcome was inevitable. **To** might be seen as part of the
infinitive to fail, certainly it needs to be followed by a verb in
infinitive form.

> *He was bound to fail.*

A complex or ongoing relationship between the outcome (failure), and
some other factor (his preconceptions):

> *His failure was bound up with his preconceptions.*

especially as a possible solution to a problem, to see if it works or
not.

## I have got \| I have gotten

In UK English, **have got** is the only grammatical possibility. In US
English, there is no situation where you could grammatically substitute
one for the other without changing the meaning.

In general, **have got** is the present perfect form of "to get" in UK
English, while **have gotten** is the US English version.

However, even in US English, **have got** is used in certain instances,
namely to mean present tense have (in the sense of possession, or to
mean must):

> *I have got a lot of friends.* (=I have a lot of friends)

> *I have got to go now.* (=I have to go now/I must go now)

**Gotten** is probably the most distinctive of all the AmE/BrE
grammatical differences, but British people who try to use it often get
it wrong. It is not simply an alternative for *have got*. **Gotten** is
used in such contexts as

> *They\'ve gotten a new boat.* (= obtain)

> *They\'ve gotten interested.* (= become)

> *He\'s gotten off the chair.* (= moved)

But it is not used in the sense of possession (= have). AmE does not
allow

> *I\'ve gotten the answer.*

> *I\'ve gotten plenty.*

but uses *I\'ve got* as in informal BrE.

The availability of **gotten **does however mean that AmE can make such
distinctions as the following:

> *They\'ve got to leave* (they must leave)

> *They\'ve gotten to leave* (they\'ve managed to leave).

***

## divide \| separate

**Separate** means to take apart / keep apart

> *Separate the wheat from the chaff.*

**Separate** implies that the things in question are being separated by
some property of those things. For example, I might separate my white
shirts from the rest of my clothes and wash them separately with bleach,
or I might separate the power cords and data cords when reorganizing the
tangled mess of wires under my desk.

**Divide** implies that the things in question are being divided into
certain quantities. For example, I might divide my laundry into
baskets/loads, or I might divide my pizza into equal portions for
everyone in the room. This is consistent with the mathematical concept
of division.

Often means there is intent in making the disaggregation.

> *The food was divided among the campers.*

## dummy \| fake \| mock \| stub

**Dummy** objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually
they are just used to fill parameter lists.

**Fake** objects actually have working implementations, but usually take
some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory
database is a good example).

**Stubs** provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually
not responding at all to anything outside what\'s programmed in for the
test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email
gateway stub that remembers the messages it "sent", or maybe only how
many messages it "sent".

**Mocks** are objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a
specification of the calls they are expected to receive. A mock is not
setup in a predetermined way so you have code that does it in your test.
Mocks in a way are determined at runtime since the code that sets the
expectations has to run before they do anything.

## package \| packet \| parcel

A **parcel** or **package** is an object or group of objects wrapped in
paper, that can be carried somewhere or sent by post. The two words have
almost exactly the same meaning in British English, but a **parcel**
usually has a more regular shape than a **package**.

> *Charities sent parcels of food and clothes to the refugees.*

> *I am taking this package to the post office.*

In American English, **package** is usually used rather than **parcel**.

In British English, a **packet** is a small container in which a
quantity of something is sold. Packets are either small boxes made of
thin cardboard, or bags or envelopes made of paper or plastic.

## replace by \| replace with

If you are referring to replacing something that is broken, old, or not
working/inoperative, then you **replace** it **with** a new one.

If you are referring to filling the role of someone or something with a
substitute, then it is **replaced by**.

> *Human bank tellers have all but been replaced by ATMs.*

> *Adam was replaced by Bill* (Bill decided that Adam had to be replaced,

## inform about \| inform of \| inform on

**inform of** merely talks about the information of something

**inform about** means, not only will she be informed that Joe is
kidnapped but also the details:

> *I\'ll have to inform her **about** Joe\'s kidnapping*

authority

## communicate to \| communicate with

If you **communicate with** someone, you share or exchange information
with them, for example by speaking, writing, or using equipment:

> *My natural mother has never communicated with me.*

You can also say that two people communicate:

> *They communicated in sign language.*

**communicate to**: if you communicate information, a feeling, or an
idea to someone, you let them know about it:

> *They successfully communicate their knowledge to others.*

## experience \| an experience \| experiences

**Countable**: an event or incident. It is an event that you were a part
of and the event made an impression on you (it's something you will
remember). These type of experiences are countable, just like events.

> *Climbing Mount Everest was an **experience** that I'll never forget.*

> *I have had some bad **experiences** with taxi drivers.*

**Uncountable**: familiarity. You have used computers for many years, so
you are familiar with them, you have knowledge of them, and you have
skill using them:

## people's lives \| peoples' lives \| people's life \| in the lives of people

The rule here is you should always have an S with one-word possessives
(*car's* (belonging to the car), *dog's* (of the dog), *Amy's*) and you
should ONLY put the apostrophe after the 's' if two conditions are met:

-   The noun that is possessing is plural (if it belongs to the cars,
    the dogs, or the women)
-   The plural noun ends in s:

>> *the cars' steering wheels*

>> *the dogs' bowls*

>> *the women's spouses*

The culture of the singular people:

> *the people's culture*

The culture belonging to several peoples:

> *the peoples' culture*

A movement that belongs to ALL of the people:

> *the people's movement*

Movements belonging to each individual:

> *the people's movements*

**People's lives** would refer to a condition that affects a group in
general:

> *People's lives can be destroyed by sudden climatic events.*

You would use an article with **people's life** and it is restrictive in
that it refers to a more specific group, like a tribe or a race:

> *The people's life changed for the better when they found a closer
> source of water.*

If you want to identify the people specifically as being alive and
breathing, then you'd say **people's lives** (what we usually say). If
you only want to accentuate the life itself, and you're not really
considering the people to be an important part of the idea, then you'd
say **in the lives of people** (sounds rather strange, but it's not
actually "wrong" in any real sense).

## people \| peoples \| Peoples \| persons

**Persons** is especially associated with its use in legal language, in
which it's often used rather than people to ensure clarity by
emphasizing that the text is referring to multiple individuals, as
opposed to a group as a whole:

> *Occupancy is limited to 200 persons.*

> *Any person or persons found to be in violation of these rules shall be
> prohibited from participating.*

When **persons** is used in this way outside of legal texts, it has
historically been regarded as overly formal or stilted.

**Persons** is sometimes used with terms related to identity to
emphasize individuality, such as saying Jewish **persons** instead of
Jewish **people**.

Regardless of intent, though, statements that are made about individuals
with a common identity can lead to overgeneralization or stereotyping,
so it's always best to consider whether the individuals' common identity
is an essential part of what you're trying to say. Choosing how to refer
to people can also be informed by preferences around language that's
*person-first* (as in **person** with autism) or identity-first (as in
autistic **person**).

The word **peoples** is specifically used as the plural of people in its
sense as a collective singular noun referring to a nation, or tribe, or
other community:

> *the many peoples of the world*

Capitalization is increasingly used as a form of respect and distinction
for terms that relate to identity (specific, distinct communities):

> *Indigenous Peoples*

> *Hispanic Peoples*

## cover by \| cover in \| cover with

The meanings are very similar, and these three prepositions can be used
almost interchangeably:

> *The mountain is covered with/in/by snow.*

When referring to a substance that sticks to another, use **in** or
**with**, but not **by**:

> *The actress was covered **in** blood.*

> *The actress was covered **with** blood.*

> ~~*The actress was covered by blood.*~~

> *The ribs were covered **with** sauce.*

> *The ribs were covered **in** sauce.*

> ~~*The ribs were covered by sauce.*~~

When referring something that physically protects something else, use
**with** or **by**, but not **in**:

> *The field was covered **with** a tarp.*

> *The field was covered **by** a tarp.*

> ~~*The field was covered in a tarp.*~~

Use **covered with** to indicate an unusual amount of something on top
of something else; use **covered by** to connote a covering so dense
that the object being covered is completely obscured from view:

> *The mountain was covered **with** fog.*

> *The mountain was covered **by** fog.*

> *Our grass was covered **with** butterflies.*

> *Our grass was covered **by** butterflies.*

When talking about metaphorical coverage, use **covered by**:

> *The roof damage was covered **by** insurance.*

> ~~*The roof damage was covered with insurance.*~~

> ~~*The roof damage was covered in insurance.*~~

> *The city council meeting was covered **by** the news station.*

> ~~*The city council meeting was covered with the news station.*~~

> ~~*The city council meeting was covered in the news station.*~~

## duty \| responsibility

-   **Duty** is a moral commitment to something or someone, whereas
    **responsibility** is a condition of being responsible.
-   As **duty** refers to moral commitment, it denotes an active feeling
    for doing something.
-   In case of **duty**, the person will be involved in activity without
    any self-interest.
-   **Responsibility** can be termed as an ability to act at one's own
    will, without any supervision. It is the obligation to successfully
    complete an assigned task.
-   In **responsibility**, a person is solely responsible for the entire
    task and its outcome. It is the responsibility of the parents to
    give good education to their children.
-   Once a person engages himself with some **duty** or if he has been
    entrusted with a duty, then that person fully commits himself to it.

***

## job \| work

**Work** is both a verb and a noun, whereas **job** is only a noun.

**Job** refers to a particular employment role or position, such as
cook, teacher or banker, whereas **work** refers in a more general
way to activities that you do.

All **jobs** involve **work** but doing work isn't always part of
a job. For example, someone can spend the weekend working in their
garden. However, this is a free time activity, and so it is not his
or her job.

If you describe how a machine **works**, you explain how it
functions:

> *Can someone show me how the photocopier works?*

> *Don't try to use that computer. It doesn't work.*

**Job** can also refer to a specific task that requires **work** and
a task that you can specifically identify:

> *I have a few jobs to do at home this weekend. I need to paint my
> bedroom, fix a broken door and cut the grass.*

> *The **work** that I do in my **job** is very interesting, so even
> though it is hard work, I don't think I will look for another job!*

> *Are you a student or do you have a **job**? Whatever you do, is it
> hard **work**?*

## part \| a part

Both **part** and **a part** can be used to refer to a discrete
countable thing:

> *We teach several skills. Dancing is **part** of what we teach.*

> *We teach several skills. Dancing is **a part** of what we teach.*

Both **part** and **a part** can be used to refer to a more general
portion of a thing that is not countable:

> ***Part** of the food* \[or money, or care\] *will be devoted to
> the poor.*

> ***A part** of the food* \[or money, or care\] *will be devoted to
> the poor.*

The portion to be devoted is not defined in these sentences as
comprising a specific discrete section or item, but either
construction is clear and appropriate. The addition of the article
a may give a slight connotation that the portion may already be
determined, but not necessarily.

## argument \| parameter

**Parameter** is a variable in the declaration of a function. An
**argument** is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to
the function. Parameters are named at declaration time, arguments are
known only at call time.

***

## dedicated \| devoted

**Devoted**: commitment to a particular activity or object. It\'s
particularly used to talk about someone\'s love for their family:

> *He\'s a devoted father.*

> *She was devoted to her grandchildren.*

We can use it, perhaps less frequently, to talk about other areas of
life:

> *Years of devoted research finally produced results.*

> *The teachers were devoted to their students.*

The central meaning is that effort and concentration are involved
in the object of the devotion. And it\'s worth noting that the noun
**devotions** might also mean religious activities like praying.

**Dedicated** is a more general word. If you are dedicated to
something, you believe that it\'s right and worthwhile and you give
a lot of time and effort to it. It\'s especially useful to talk about
someone\'s attitude to their job:

> *A **dedicated** worker*

> *A **dedicated** vegetarian* (believes very strongly that people
> should not eat animals)

> *A song on the radio might be **dedicated** to a particular
> person.*

A **dedication** is a statement which says who a book has been
written for or who a song has been sung for.

***

## host \| node

Every network **host** is a physical network **node** (i.e. a network
device), but not every physical network node is a host. Network
devices such as modems, hubs and network switches are not assigned
host addresses (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and
are consequently not considered to be network hosts. Devices such as
network printers and hardware routers have IP addresses, but since
they are not general-purpose computers, they are sometimes not
considered to be hosts.

  | notion | definition                                                           |

  | node   | a device that implements IPv6                                        |
  | router | a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to itself |
  | host   | any node that is not a router                                        |

## provide \| provide for \| provide with

**Provide**: the result/outcome is the direct object:

> *A house provides shelter.*

> *My job provides income.* (= My job provides me with income.)

**Provide with:** *provide* is followed by an indirect object.
**Providing** (someone) **with** something means to give something
wanted or needed:

> *Room to Read **provides** girls **with** scholarships that cover the cost
> of housing, food, and books.*

In this sentence, *girls* is the indirect object and *scholarships* is
the direct object.

**Provide for**, in general, means to make whatever is necessary for
someone available to him or her. We often use this expression when we
talk about parents providing for their family:

> *She says changes such as migration away from rural areas are allowing
  more women to find work and **provide for** their families.*

**Provide for** can mean *prepare for*:

> *The architect **provided for** the possibility of storms by
  strengthening the abutments.*

> *The architect **provided** the possibility of storms by strengthening the
  abutments* (= stronger abutments are somehow supposed to invoke storms).

## em dash \| en dash \| hyphen \| minus \| three-em dash \| two-em dash

**Дефис** (hyphen, -) употребляют в середине слова:

- в составных словах:

>> *three-em dash*

>> *off-white shirt*

-   для обозначения переносов
-   для отделения корней от префиксов и суффиксов:

>> *co-worker*

-   в названиях:

>> *Tay-Sachs disease*

**Минус** (minus, −) может быть немного длиннее дефиса. Употребляется
для обозначения отрицательного числа или операции вычитания. В
зависимости от шрифта можно заменить дефисом или коротким тире.

**Короткое тире** (En dash, --) равно по ширине букве n в прописном
или строчном варианте, в зависимости от шрифта. В некоторых шрифтах
может быть длиннее или короче.

-   обозначение диапазонов:

>> *June 18--20*

-   акцент на контрасте или взаимоотношении между двумя объектами:

>> *New York--London flight*

>> *Radical--Unionist coalition*

>> *mother--daughter relationship*

-   некоторые предпочитают заменять этим знаком длинное тире

**Длинное тире** (Em dash, ---) равно по ширине букве *m* в прописном
или строчном варианте, а в некоторых шрифтах и длиннее. Если
поставить рядом несколько длинных тире, они образуют сплошную линию.

-   вместо запятой, двоеточия или скобок. Разница в том, что длинное
    тире обозначает более длинную и выразительную интонационную паузу.

-   отделение источника в цитатах:

>> *In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the
   vital thing.* --- Oscar Wilde

-   в американском английском длинное тире не принято отделять
    пробелами от предшествующего слова:

>> *A flock of sparrows---some of them juveniles---alighted and
   sang.*

-   иногда вместо длинного тире используют короткое тире с пробелом:

>> *A flock of sparrows -- some of them juveniles -- alighted and
   sang.*

**Двойное длинное тире** (two-em dash, ------) --- два длинных тире,
поставленных рядом без пробела. Указывает, что часть слова опущена.
Обычно так обозначают имена либо ругательства:

> *Mr. L------ told Ms. T------ that he would be d------d if he
  invited her out again.*

**Тройное длинное тире** (three-em dash, ---------) --- три длинных
тире, поставленных рядом без пробела. Указывает, что опущено
(повторяющееся) слово. Особенно актуален этот знак для библиографий,
где тройное тире вместо имени автора означает, что автор тот же, что
и для предыдущего пункта в списке.

Правила не универсальны. Иногда в сложносоставных прилагательных
употребляют короткое тире вместо дефиса или не отделяют длинное тире
от текста пробелами даже в британском варианте английского.

## comma before a subordinate conjunction

A subordinate clause will not form a complete sentence. It will
instead make a reader want additional information to finish the
thought. The examples of subordinate conjunctions are **after,
although, as, because, before, even if, even, though, if, in order
that, once, since, so that, than, that, though, unless**, etc.

The rule is to use a comma after the subordinate clause rather than
before the subordinate conjunction:

> *Jonathon spent his class time reading comic books since his
  average was a 45 one week before final exams.*

> *Since Jonathon\'s class average was a 45 one week before final
  exams, he spent his class time reading comic books.*

requirements, then it is uncountable:

## interfere in \| interfere with

In the case of someone else's life, you can either **interfere in**
or **with**. The former is critical of the fact that you meddled at
all.
The latter is critical of the results of your meddling.

To **interfere with** means to disrupt:

> *Wave patterns can interfere with each other* (they are mutually
  disruptive).

Whilst it\'s true that **interfering in** someone else\'s affairs may
be disruptive, it needn't be. But if you **interfere with** their
affairs, you\'re definitely having a bad influence. There\'s also the
idiomatic usage of a paedophile **interfering with** a victim, which
normally refers specifically to touching a child\'s genitals.

## amend \| emend \| mend

**Amend** defines the action of slightly changing some words in
a document. It is used a lot more frequently than **emend** and
it is most likely to be found in passive voice.

The meaning of **emend** is confined to textual alterations, and
**amend** can be broadened to include the general improvement of
other things. Still, **amend** is mostly used in the sense of
improving text.

> *The contract has been **amended**, terms have slightly changed
> now.*

If you're not a professional editor who specializes in proof-reading,
than you'll probably never use or read **emend** in this form.
**Emend** is mostly present in contexts related to professional,
technical writing and editing, and it defines the action of improving
a text through editing.

> *I hired a professional to **emend** my contract and make sure
> everything is alright before presenting it to the other parties.*

To **mend** something is to fix something that was broken or that had
a problem:

> *to **mend** a punctured tyre*

> *to **mend** a broken heart*

If you're talking about fixing a rip in a shirt, you would be better
to just use the word **mend**; to ~~amend the shirt~~ would sound
strange. The Constitution of the U.S. may be **amended** (as it has
been) but if the actual document itself were damaged and required
restoration I don't think anyone would say the team that did the work
amended the Constitution.

**artefact**: British English

**Artifact**: An object produced or shaped by human craft, especially
a tool, weapon, or ornament of archaeological or historical interest.

**Artefact**: An artificial product or effect observed in a natural
system, especially one introduced by the technology used in
scientific investigation or by experimental error.

But they are generally used to mean *an archaelogical find*.

## for + gerund | to + infinitive

Some verbs can be used with a gerund (verb-ing) or an infinitive
(to + verb), but the meaning changes. For example:

- **Like**: can be used with both gerunds and infinitives without
much change in meaning, however:

	- **like + gerund**: you enjoy something:

		> *I **like going** on holiday.*

	- **like + to + infinitive**: you want to say that you think it\'s
	a good idea:

		> *I **like to go** to the dentist every 6 months.*

- **Stop**

	> *I **stopped working**.* (I was working, then I stopped)

	> *I **stopped to** answer the phone.* (This is the reason I stopped)

- **Remember**

	> *I\'m sure I bought the milk -- I **remember buying** it!*
	(I did it, and now I remember it -- buy first, remember after!)

	> *Don\'t worry -- I **remembered to** buy the milk.*
	(I thought of it, then I did it -- remember first, buy after!)

- **Forget**

	> *I\'ll never **forget buying** my first car*
	(I did it, and I won\'t forget it -- buy first, (not) forget after)

	> *I **forgot to** buy the milk.*
	(I didn\'t do it because I forgot -- forget first, buy after)

- **Try**

	> *I couldn\'t sleep, so I **tried drinking** warm milk.*
	(This was one possible way to achieve what I wanted)

	> *I **tried to** sleep, but the music was too loud.*
	(This is what I wanted to achieve, but it was difficult, and maybe
	I didn\'t succeed)

- **Need**

	> *He **needs to** clean the toilet.* (Active, he should do it)

	> *The toilet **needs cleaning**.* (Passive, someone should do
	it -- it should be done)

- **Go on**

	> *I **went on** working all night.* (I continued this)

	> *I was a teacher, but I **went on** to work as a journalist.*
	(this is what I did next)

- **Mean**

	> *I **mean to** learn Japanese one day.* (I plan to do this)

	> *Learning Japanese **means learning** to write kanji.*
	(it involves this)

## miss from \| miss in

**miss in**: something or somebody is lost within something. You
suppose that their existence is true, but their temporal or
spatial position is missing:

> ***Missing in** action*

> *What\'s **missing in** your apartment?*

**miss from**: something is lost entirely from its source, and
whether or not it was there to begin with is irrelevant.

> *Copy of check is **missing from** the file*

~~Missing in the file~~ doesn\'t make sense because it\'s *not* in
the file. The only use I can think of for **missing in** is when
something (or someone) goes missing:

> *John went **missing in** Paris*

> *I missed that new car **in** the first version of this computer
  game so much.* = You obtained the first version of the game after
  you had already played version two. You regret going back to an
  older version.

> *I missed that new car **from** the first version of this computer
  game so much.* = The car was in the first version but was absent
  from the second version.

P.S. You can\'t really miss something until you have it. You don\'t
say to a girl you just met, *I\'ve missed you all my life.* After you
know her, and she goes away, then you can miss her.

> *I missed you while you were on vacation.*

## lack \| miss

To **lack** something = to not have something (usually something
desirable or essential):

> *I would take the radio apart, but I **lack** a screwdriver.*

To **miss** = to regret the absence of something or someone:

> *I would take the radio apart but I have lost my screwdriver, it
  was a particularly good one and I **miss** it.*

> *My wife died three years ago and I still **miss** her. You ask if
  I **lack** a wife; I suppose I do but I have no desire to remarry.*

However, you can say, to be **missing** something = to **lack**
because of the loss of a previously owned object:

> *I would take the radio apart, but I am **missing** a screwdriver.
  I can\'t find it anywhere, I must have lost it.*

***

## solution for \| solution of \| solution to

Generally we use **to**:

> *We have the **solution to** all your problems.*

You can use **solutions for** when speaking of the recipient of
the solution, as opposed to linking a solution to a problem:

> *We have **solutions for** your family in your time of need.*

It depends on your use of the word *solution*:

> *What's the **solution to** the problem?* (the answer to the
  problem)

> *He won £10,000 for the **solution of** the math problem.* (the
  solving of the problem)

In chemistry:

*A **solution of** hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide.*

## activity \| activities \| assignment \| drill \| exercise \| problem \| task

An **exercise** is a teaching procedure that involves controlled,
guided or open ended practice of some aspect of language. A drill,
a cloze activity, a reading comprehension passage can all be regarded
as exercises.

Main characteristics of exercises:

- A language exercise is guided and controlled by the teacher.

- An exercise usually has a restrictive focus on a single language
  element, and has a linguistic outcome.

- The focus is usually on a single skill.

- There is no reference to the context.

- A language  exercise is not communicative and usually not authentic.

- It is not meaningful and the focus is on form rather than on content.

- Correction is usually done immediately.

**Drill** and practice is a disciplined and repetitious exercise,
used as a mean of teaching and perfecting a skill or procedure.
Similar to memorization, drill and practice involves repetition of
specific skills, such as spelling or multiplication.

The term **activity** refers to any kind of purposeful classroom
procedure that involves learners doing something that relates to the
goals of the course. For example singing a song, playing a game,
taking part in a debate, having a group discussion, are all different
kinds of teaching activities.

Its plural form i.e. **activities** refer to an occupation or some
kind of outdoor activity.

A **task**:

1) (A general definition) A piece of work done as part of one’s
   duties. A task is usually done under the supervision of someone
   and needs to be completed on time. It requires focus and there’s
   always an intention associated with it. The main purpose of
   performing a task is to complete it in the given time duration.

2) A communicative act that, in the main, is meaning-based,
   goal-oriented, and purposeful with a non-linguistic and
   communicative outcome.

- Tasks are free. Students are given free will to use language for
  communicative purposes.

- Focus on multiple skills rather than on one.

- Tasks are used in context.

- Tasks are communicative and usually authentic.

- Tasks are meaningful and focus is on content.

- Correction of tasks is delayed and is done through observation and
  awareness raising.

**Task** requires supervision and comes with a deadline and it cannot
be left incomplete while activity need not necessarily require
supervision. The **activity** has no such deadline and it’s a
continuous process. The primary focus while doing a task is in
completing it while the primary function in performing an activity is
in doing it.

An **assignment** is work given to you by your boss/coworker.
**Task** could be the same but it can also mean the work that you
assigned to yourself.

A **problem** is a question proposed for solution or discussion.
Problems have many possible solutions and figuring out the right one
for a given situation allows for ownership of that solution.
**Tasks**, on the other hand, are a known entity. There’s already
a solution, and you only have to physically go through the steps of
completing it. There’s not much thought required, and if the task
popped up frequently enough, you’d consider automating it.

## accidentally \| coincidentally \| coincidently \| incidentally

**Accidental** and **incidental** can both mean "something happening
by chance," but usage suggests that **accidental** also implies an
element of carelessness or inattention while **incidental** implies
the occurrence would have happened with or without attention or care.

**Accident** and **incident** share the idea of a sudden and
unpleasant occurrence. **Accident** usually refers directly to
something that causes damage or injury, **incident** -- to a specific
moment or instance of unpleasantness or unlawfulness:

> *a traffic **accident***

> *isolated **incidents** were reported*

**Coincidentally** relates to luck, in a way, to two or more events
at one time apparently by mere chance.

> *You happen to call me on the phone. In the course of our
  conversation you happen to mention where you are. By luck
  (**coincidentally**), you happen to be very close to where I am and
  that will make it easy for me to meet up with you in person.*

**Coincidently** is *simultaneously*

**Incidentally** is more like *by the way*.

> *By the way (**incidentally**), I am going to be out of town next
  weekend so I can\'t go to the movies like we planned.*

## furthermore, however, moreover, therefore (punctuation)

1. At the beginning of a sentence: put a comma after these words
   (some modern writers are now dropping the comma).

   > ***Therefore**, we will proceed with the order.*

   > ***However**, we still have hope.*

   1.1. A traditional rule stated that **however** meaning
        *nevertheless* should not be used at the beginning of
        a sentence. Most style guides consider this rule
        old-fashioned.

2. Use a semicolon and comma to introduce a new independent clause
   (a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses
   a complete thought.)

   > *She always meets her deadlines; **furthermore**, her work is
     good.*

   > *We plan to stay for another year; **however**, Peter is leaving
     now.*

   2.1. Some writers are now treating *however, therefore, moreover*
        and *furthermore* as conjunctions and just using a comma:
   
   >> *We plan to stay for another year, **however** Peter is leaving
      now.*

   2.2. You can also use **however** as a conjunction to mean *by
        whatever means*:
   
   >> *I don’t care **however** you do it, just get it done.*

3. As intensifiers or for emphasis:

   > *You can, **therefore**, do whatever you like.*

   > *The vegetables, **furthermore**, are good for you.*

## condition for \| condition of

The **conditions for** some state of affairs are the conditions that
must exist in order for that state of affairs to exist:

> *the **conditions for** a hail storm*

The **condition of** something is the state that it is in. This is
a different definition of condition.

> *the **condition of** a car engine*

## error \| failure \| fault

IEEE Definitions

**Failure**: External behavior is incorrect

**Fault**: Discrepancy in code that causes a failure

**Error**: Human mistake that caused fault

Note:

  • **Error** is terminology of Developer

  • **Bug** is terminology of Tester

## learn how to \| learn to

> *I want to **learn to** speak French* = *I want to **learn how to**
  speak French*

> *he **learned how to** obey*

> *he **learned to** obey* = he learned that he must to obey

Obviously the child already knows how to avoid making a noise, so
*learn* has a somewhat different meaning here:

> *I wish you\'d **learn to** be quiet in church*

## error \| mistake

**mistake**: a decision which brought unsuccessful results:

> *Her decision to sell the house was a big **mistake**.*

A **mistake** is usually accidental, you know it is wrong. Otherwise,
an **error**  is usually made due to the lack of knowledge and is
more formal and technical than **mistake**.

Machines never make **mistakes**, but rather they make **errors**.
People can make both.

The person who is making the **error** doesn’t know that he is doing
something wrong. For example, you do not understand some concepts in
math, so you make a lot of errors. Now, imagine a situation where you
understand and know the concepts, but you did the calculations in
a rush. You had knowledge, but it’s your carelessness that resulted
in the mistakes.

## privilege \| right

### Law

A **right** is something that every person is born with and is
inalienable, which means that it cannot be given, taken away, or
denied by anyone. Another distinction between a right and a
**privilege** is that a right does not need to be earned or worked
for. For example, free speech is a right because anyone can speak
freely and there is nothing anyone has to do to be able to freely
speak and it does not cost anyone else anything to have free speech.
On the other hand, a driver’s license is a privilege because anyone
that wants to get one has to be a certain age, be free from
limitations such as being blind, and must pass a test first. This
license can be denied or taken away when a person does not meet the
qualifications or violates the driving laws.

***

## permission \| privilege

### General

**permission**: authorization granted to do something; formal consent

**privilege**: a grant to an individual, corporation, etc., of
a special right or immunity, under certain conditions.

### IT

**permission**: a rule associated with an object to regulate which
users can gain access to the object and in what manner. Permissions
are assigned or denied by the object\'s owner.

**privilege**: authorization to perform a specific action or set of
actions on a managed object or group of managed objects.

- **permissions** are given to roles, **privileges** are given to
  people;

- a **permission** is asked for, a **privilege** is granted;

- **permissions** are situation-based, **privileges** are time-based.

So typically, as used in IT security, privileges determine
permissions. A user, through their account, is granted
the **privilege** of reading a particular type of record
(or a particular record) by the administrator of a system; this is
typically done once, or as needed over time. The application, acting
on behalf of the user who has authenticated themselves using the
account, then asks for **permission** to perform an action each and
every time it must do so, and the system grants this permission in
each situation after examining the privileges of the user.

## license \| permit

A **license** is a legally binding contract that allows someone or
something to do, own, perform an action or use a service as long as
they agree to the provided terms and conditions. Examples of licenses
are driving licenses, software licenses and business licenses. All
these have terms and conditions attached to them and must be followed
for the license to be put to action.

A **permit** is an official document which gives an individual
permission to do carry out an activity.

A person may have a driving ***permit*** before attaining a certain
age, and once that age is attained, a ***license*** is given. This is
the same case for a person who has a ***license*** to carry on pest
control business but must have a ***permit*** to store the chemicals.

#### Differences between permits and licenses
                                                                                                    
**1. Period of Validity**

  In most cases, ***licenses*** are permanent while ***permits***
  are temporary. For instance, in driving, a permit is valid for up
  to two years in most places while licenses are permanent, although
  they can also be annulled in case of misuse of the said license.

**2. Different restrictions**

  ***Licenses*** have few restrictions if any. On the other hand,
  ***permits*** have a lot of restrictions. ***Permits*** restrict
  on the time an activity can be carried out, who is carrying out
  the activity, where the activity is being carried out and also
  whether supervision is available. Most activities that are carried
  out with the authority of a ***license*** do not have such
  restrictions. For instance, a driver’s license does not have
  restrictions on where, whom and when to drive, as long it is
  within the allowed territory.

**3. Inspection periods**

  ***Permits*** require regular safety regulation inspections from
  the relevant authorities. ***Licenses***, on the other hand, may
  require inspection, but not as regular.

**4. Appearance**

  While appearance is mainly a non-issue, licenses and permits are
  in most cases not similar. For instance, most ***permits*** may be
  a sticker but a ***license*** may be updated to a card.

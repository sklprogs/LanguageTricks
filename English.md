**Possible**&mdash;capable of happening, existing, or being true without contradicting proven facts, laws, or circumstances:

> *Is it **possible** to move faster than the speed of light?*

**Potential**&mdash;capable of being but not yet in existence; latent or undeveloped:

> *A **potential** problem.*

> *A substance with many **potential** uses.*

***

## outside \| outside of

***Outside of***:

- not recommended for formal writing;
- tends to be more commonly used in the US than in Britain;
- often used as a colloquial way of saying *except for*, *other than*, *apart from*:

> ***Outside of** what I just mentioned, I can’t think of any reason not to.*

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9700/outside-or-outside-of)

***

## goal \| objective

**Goal**&mdash;an achievable outcome that is typically broad and long-term. A company might use goals to inform yearly strategies that each department will execute.

An ***objective*** defines the specific, measurable actions each team employee must take to achieve the overall goal.

***Goals*** provide direction whereas ***objectives*** measure how you should follow that direction.

| Goal | Objective |
|------|-----------|
| Open a new company HQ in Phoenix, AZ by Q4. | Obtain all licensing and permit documents by Q2. |
| Increase company market share by 10%. | Grow customer base by 22% month-over-month for the next 12 months. |
| Reduce donut cost by 18% in the next five years. | Switch to a lower-cost sugar provider in the next six months. |

## essential \| necessary

***Essential*** means something is indispensable or vital to the *existence*, *function*, or *success* of something else, and cannot be omitted or replaced:

> *Water is **essential** for life.*

> *Good communication skills are **essential** for success in business.*

***Necessary*** refers to something that is required or needed in order to achieve a particular goal or outcome. It suggests that something is required for a specific purpose or situation, but may not be indispensable or vital in all circumstances:

> *It is **necessary** to have a driver’s license to operate a vehicle.*

> *It is **necessary** to study for the exam in order to pass.*

*See also* [essentially \| substantially](#essentially--substantially)

**Need**&mdash;a basic necessity or desire that an individual requires to survive or thrive:

> *Children have a fundamental **need** for love and affection from their parents.*

**Requirement**&mdash;a specific condition or demand that must be met to achieve a particular objective or goal:

> *Passing the exam is a **requirement** for obtaining a driver’s license.*

Compare:

> *I **need** a degree to get this job* \[a degree is a personal desire or preference, rather than a necessary qualification\].

> *A degree is a **requirement** for this job* \[a degree is a non-negotiable qualification\].

> *It is a **requirement** that all employees attend the meeting* \[there will be consequences for those who do not attend\].

> *It is necessary for all employees to attend the meeting* \[simply emphasizes the importance of attending without implying consequences\].

### Business

***Needs*** are goals and objectives a business must achieve, whereas ***requirements*** are the things we need to do in order to achieve a need. Converting business needs into specific, measurable, relevant requirements is very important for the success of a business.

## mount at \| mount in \| mount on \| ~~mount to~~

Google Books Ngram Viewer [suggests](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=mounted+on+the+mount+point%2Cmounted+to+the+mount+point%2Cmounted+in+the+mount+point%2Cmounted+at+the+mount+point&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3) *mounted **on** the mount point* only.

Levin (English Verb Classes and Alternations) places *mount* under “Verbs of Putting”, and specifically says that the preposition ***to*** is wrong for such verbs. She lists some “Verbs of Combining and Attaching” which take the preposition *to* (*add*, *connect*, *join*, *link*), but does not include *mount* among them.

Other uses:

> *In the same year the entartete Kunst exhibition was **mounted in** Munich.*

> *The Party bitterly opposed the conspiracy theory that Evatt **mounted at** the Petrov Royal Commission.*

> *Residents suggest the deployment of an army unit to curb constant attacks **mounted by** the Somali Bandits in the area.*

> *These towers were manned day and night and were **mounted with**[^mount_with] a machine gun, rifle and searchlight.*

[^mount_with]: mount with = оборудовать, оснащать

> *Demands are **mounting for** a high-powered investigation with Liberal shadow minister Senator David Johnston today warning sex abuse claims were harming the reputation of the Catholic Church.*

## state \| status

**State**&mdash;the condition or mode of something at a particular time (temporary).

**Status**&mdash;the position or standing of something in relation to others; it describes in what step of a certain process an object is (permanent or long-lasting).

if you are checking the ***state*** of your computer, you are checking its current condition. On the other hand, if you are checking the ***status*** of your computer, you are checking its position in relation to others (e.g. whether it is online or offline).

***Status*** is one-dimensional, i.e., it is determined by a single value (e.g., the social rank of a person, the amount of progress made by a project, the goodness of an outcome, etc.) usually ranging from good to bad, desirable to undesirable, or the like.

***State*** is “all the rest”: it is either n-dimensional, or it does not refer to something that can be ordered by quality.

> The package’s ***state*** can be *mint*, *broken*, *partly broken*, while its ***status*** can be *ready*, *in delivery*, *delayed*, *delivered*, *lost*.

> A soldier’s ***state*** is *wounded* and his ***status*** is *awaiting surgery*.

> A lab specimen’s ***state*** is *frozen* and its **status** is *to be discarded in 2029*.

| Field | State | Status | Example |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| IT | the current condition of a system or application | the information about the system or application that is displayed to the user | An application might display the ***status*** of a file transfer process, while the ***state*** of the application might be *running* or *idle*. **Status** (jargon) might refer to a specific message or code that indicates whether a task has been completed successfully or not. |
| Psychology | current mental and emotional condition | position or role in a social hierarchy | A person’s ***state*** might be *happy* or *anxious*, while their status might be *leader* or *follower*. |
| Law | jurisdiction or government under which the individual or entity falls | legal position or standing within that jurisdiction | An individual might have the legal ***status*** of *citizen* within a particular ***state***. |
| Medicine | current physical condition | overall prognosis | A patient’s ***state*** might be *stable* or *critical*, while their ***status*** might be *improving* or *worsening*. |

## located \| placed \| positioned \| situated

### Located vs positioned

***Location*** refers to a specific place or area, while ***position*** refers to the arrangement or placement of something within that location relative to a reference point or system. For example, if you’re talking about a building, its location would be its physical address or coordinates, while its position could refer to its orientation on a plot of land or its location in a city’s skyline.

| Context   | Location | Position |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Geography | The location of a city on a map | The position of a landmark within that city |
| Business  | The location of a company’s headquarters | The position of an employee within that company |
| Design    | The location of a design element on a webpage | The position of that element in relation to other elements |

### Located vs situated

***Situated***: emphasis on context, surroundings, not just the coordinates, less used in casual conversation:

> *This sylvan abode is beautifully **situated** in the Green Mountains of Vermont.*

> *The car is <u>precariously</u> **situated** on the cliff.* [The car’s orientation is precarious in addition to its location]

Carries an echo of situation:

> *How did you get me into this **situation** (~~*location*~~)?*

### Located vs placed

***Located*** means you found something:

> *I **located** the car.*

***Placed*** means you set, or left something somewhere:

> *I **placed** the keys on the table.*

> *Did you **locate** the hidden camera that I **placed** in your...*

### Aspects

1. In biology, it’s common to use the term ***position*** (but not ~~*location*~~) when referring to the specific location of a gene on a chromosome.

1. In engineering, ***situated*** means *within a situation*, rather than *located in a specific place*.

1. ***Situated*** is used in the real-estate-ad kind of prose, in collocations with *beautifully, delightfully, ideally, picturesquely, pleasantly, well, conveniently, inconveniently, centrally, remotely, and quietly*.

## character \| glyph \| symbol

### General

A **character** is the symbol representing a letter.

A **glyph** is the specific shape, design, or representation of a character.

### IT

**Symbols** are names with identity (language identifiers). *Symbol* has no single universal definition and is of a semantically higher level than a *character*. In a programming language characters are meaningless until they form a statement, a keyword, an operator, an identifier, a constant or a value. What a symbol is exactly varies over languages and/or compiler implementations. In the Microsoft world they relate to debugging, they map points in a compiled program to source code locations.

## change \| modify

***Change*** refers to a complete transformation, while **modify** means to make minor adjustments or alterations.

|        | Change | Modify |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Definition | Making something different or altering its original state. | Making partial or minor alterations to something without fundamentally changing its essence or nature. |
| Scope | Can be major or minor, intentional or unintentional. | Generally minor, intentional. |
| Result | Fundamental transformation of the object, concept, or situation. | Improved functionality, performance, or effectiveness of the object, concept, or situation. |
| Examples | - *change in weather patterns* | - *modifying a recipe* |
|          | - *change in leadership, change in technology* | - *modifying a car* |
|          | - *change in personal habits* | - *modifying a software program* |

## integrate \| merge

**Itegrate**&mdash;to combine two or more things into a whole in a way that allows each part to maintain its unique identity and function. For example, a company might integrate a new software system into its existing infrastructure, allowing the two to work together smoothly while still serving their individual purposes.

**Merge**&mdash;to combine two or more things into a single entity that no longer has distinct parts or identities. For example, two companies might merge to become a single, unified organization with a new name and structure.

In software development, ***integrating*** two different programs means making them work together seamlessly without any conflicts or issues, while ***merging*** them could mean combining their codebases into a single program.

## integrate \| integrate in \| integrate into \| ~~integrate to~~ \| integrate with

**Integrate in**&mdash;combine many things into a whole:

> *We have **integrated in** companies many times.*

> *The **integration in** the bone is the most important part of the surgery.*

**Integrate into**&mdash;make something part of a larger whole:

> *They’re going to **integrate into** our building.*

***Integrate into*** can be a synonym of ***integrate in*** with the nuance that a smaller group becomes part of a larger whole

**Integrate with**&mdash;combine two similarly sized groups together:

> *I’d like to propose **integration with** the other political party.*

While *integrate in* and *integrate into* can be synonyms, ***integrate with*** cannot and specifically implies two groups merging together, rather than an entity merging into a larger group or adapting to the larger group.

While prepositions help clarify what exactly is being integrated in which situations, ***integrate*** can be used without a preposition:

> *They **integrated** the immigrants.*

## able to \| capable of

If someone is **able to** do something, they can do it and it is not unusual or
surprising if they do it:

> *The doctor said that after a few years I’d be **able to** get out of bed.*

> *Will you be **able to** play on Saturday?*

If someone is **capable of** (doing) something, they do not usually do it, but
it is possible for them to do it if they want to:

> *I’m sure he’s quite **capable of** getting here on time, but he can’t be
  bothered.*

> *The power station is **capable of** generating enough electricity for the
  whole region.*

**capable of** is also used when talking about machines and technical
equipment:

> *\...water turbines, which are **capable of** producing more economical
  electricity.*

## made from \| made of

**Made of** is used when the material the subject consists of doesn’t change
during the process of making the subject.

> *Chairs are **made of** wood.*

Here, wood is still wood. It doesn’t transform into something else.

On the other hand, **made from** is used when the material changed its nature.

> *Paper is **made from** wood.*

Now, wood disappeared&mdash;it was transformed into paper.

Some more examples:

> *The house is **made of** bricks.* \[They are still bricks.\]

> *Wine is **made from** grapes.* \[Grapes turn into wine.\]

> *I have a table and it’s **made from** bamboo.*

The carpenter took stocks of bamboo, cut them, halved them, and made them into
a table. The carpenter **modified** the bamboo’s **structural integrity**, so
my table is **made from** bamboo.

> *I have a vase and it’s made of bamboo.*

The carpenter took a stock of bamboo and carved a vase out of it. The carpenter
**didn’t modify** the bamboo’s **structural integrity**, so my vase is **made
of** bamboo.

## during \| within

**during** indicates a time frame

**within** implies a limit or deadline

This came up recently in the following sentence:

> *\... the new office will support the beneficiary \... **within** one year of
  petitioner approval.*

The business had interpreted that as *during the year of*, and it got them into
a bit of trouble. They supported the beneficiary for a year but were not able
to continue to support him after. The intent was for the position to continue,
not end.

***

## content \| contents

- **content:** the entirety of information contained in something. The story of
  a novel or the subject of an illustration can be called their "content". Just
  like "information", content is always uncountable when used in this sense.
  The word is most commonly used in reference to the content of a website:

  > *Most websites contain mostly ads with very little **content**.*

- **content/contents**: the amount of a substance contained in something else.
  It may be either countable or uncountable. We can speak of *salt content* or
  *fat content* in foods, *alcohol content* in drinks, and so on:

  > *Bacon has (a) very high salt **content**.*

- **contents:** things contained in something:

  - In a concrete sense. We can speak of the *contents of a bag*, *contents of
    a bottle*, *contents of the stomach*, etc.:

    > *He dropped a bottle and spilled its **contents** all over the floor.*

  - In an abstract sense. Traditionally, pieces of information contained in a
    written document are called its "contents":

    > *She has lost the letter and remained unaware of its **contents**.*

Using the singular ***content*** in this case is becoming increasingly more
common but is still considered wrong by many. The distinction is rather subtle;
if you consider the contents of a document to be separate pieces of
information, you should use ***contents*** (which is usually the case with a
letter). If you refer to them as a whole, you should use ***content***&mdash;it
makes more sense to say that *the book contains violent content* than *the book
contains violent contents*.

***

## borehole \| well

Typically a borehole is drilled by machine and is relatively small in diameter.
A well is usually sunk by hand and is relatively large in diameter.

[*Source*](https://www.welldrillers.org/faq/about-boreholes-and-wells/)

***

## boring \| drilling

**Drilling** is *the cutting process* of a material using a specially designed
rotating cutting tool called a drill bit. The holes produced by the drilling
are always cylindrical in shape and circular in the diameter.

**Boring** is *the process of enlarging a hole that is already in the
material*; it may be a hole made by drilling or in the casting. Boring concerns
the internal diameter and the surface of the hole rather than the depth of the
hole. In this sense, it can be considered as a twin process of turning, where
the outer diameter and the surface are the concerns. Boring is done using a
boring bar, which is a heavy metal bar with the tools fixed at the end.

[*Source*](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-drilling-and-vs-boring/)

***

## particular \| specific

As *adjectives* the difference between specific and particular is that
**specific** is explicit or definite while **particular** is (obsolete)
pertaining only to a part of something; partial.

As *nouns* the difference between specific and particular is that **specific**
is a distinguishing attribute or quality while **particular** is a small
individual part of something larger; a detail, a point.

[*Source*](https://wikidiff.com/specific/particular)

***

## part of \| a part of

Generally, you can use either.

If you say *Money is **part** of the American Dream*, you mean that both ideas
are strongly linked together. If you said *Money is **a part** of the American
Dream*, it would mean that money is only a part of the American Dream. You
would focus on just one part as opposed to the rest. The second solution is
grammatically correct but seems awkward as it would be difficult to find a
context in which it fits.

## consist in \| consist of

**Consist of**&mdash;to be made up of, comprise:

> *This novel **consists of** three parts.*

> *Genes **consist of** a specific sequence of DNA.*

**consist in**&mdash;to be essential, be inherent or lie in:

> *His social success **consists in** making people believe he is interested in
  what they say.*

The secret to a successful relationship consists in knowing that a crisis
doesn’t mean everything is over.

Some people say a key point to know which one to use is that ***consist of***
is normally used with more tangible objects whereas ***consist in*** refers to
an abstract quality.

Others also say that ***consist of*** is always followed by a noun phrase,
whereas ***consist in*** is followed by a verb.

[*Source*](http://ourenglishblog.com/grammar/consist-of-or-consist-in/)

***

## effective \| efficient

**Effective** focuses on whether or not something is accomplished. It doesn’t
focus on how something is done, but rather, if it is done at all:

> *We need an **effective** solution for everyone.*

**Efficient** focuses on how something is done: acting or producing effectively
with minimum waste, expense, or unnecessary effort:

> *My new car is very fuel-**efficient**, and it gets 40 miles per gallon.*

[*Source*](https://writingexplained.org/effective-vs-efficient-difference)

***

## efficacy \| efficiency

**Efficacy**&mdash;the power or capacity to produce a desired effect; widely
used, among other places, in the medical field:

  > *There is in still limited information on the **efficacy** of this cancer
    treatment.*

**Efficiency**&mdash;the quality or property of being efficient.

[*Source*](https://writingexplained.org/efficacy-vs-efficiency-difference)

***

## data (singular \| plural)

When ***data*** is a count noun (items that can be counted), the plural makes
sense.

> *The **data** used were out of date.*

In that type of sentence, you could replace ***data*** with another count noun
such as *facts*.

However, when ***data*** is treated as a non-count noun (items cannot be
counted), the singular makes sense.

> *The **data** used was out of date.*

With that type of sentence, you could replace ***data*** with a word such as
*information*.

[*Source*](https://www.onlinegrammar.com.au/top-10-grammar-myths-data-is-plural-so-must-take-a-plural-verb/)

***

## usage \| use

**Use**&mdash;the act of putting something into service or action:

> *Yes, I made **use** of the code you gave me.*

**Usage**:

- a customary or firmly established practice, conventions or patterns;

- the customary manner in which words are used in a language:

  > *The word prevarication is not common **usage**.* (\= *The word prevarication is not **in** common **use**.*)

- the act of using (especially when specifying a quantity):

  > *Electricity **usage** monitors are easy to use and can measure the electricity **usage** of any device that runs on 120 volts.* ([quotation](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/estimating-appliance-and-home-electronic-energy-use))

  > *Our town was asked to reduce water **usage** because of the drought.*

***Use*** has a much broader meaning and is found in more contexts. In my opinion, when in doubt, use the word ***use***.

## complement \| supplement

- **Supplement** would refer to extra/additional information. **Complement**
  refers to an item that completes or goes well with another item.

- A ***complement*** usually makes the word that it goes with complete or
  perfect. A ***supplement***, however, only helps that word. It is purely
  supplementary.

Generally, a **complement** is always the response to incompleteness that
provides the required essential part:

> *Soul is the complement for a human body to become a human being* (without
soul the body is not human being).

- A **supplement** is always the response to extra needs or demand:

  > *Spare Tyre is the supplement for any vehicle* (without the spare tyre it’s
    possible to go anywhere but it’s essential to have one).

***

## dosage \| dose

**Dose** is the amount or quantity of medicine to be taken or administered to
the patient every time in a day. If it is 5mg, then 5mg is the dose to be given
to the patient.

**Dosage** implies *the duration or the frequency* of the dose to be
administered.

## dependence \| dependency

I think *dependence* and *dependency* are like *competence* and *competency*.
Both are nouns. Yet, **dependence** emphasizes the quality of being dependent.
So, it may also be abstract. Whereas, **dependency** focuses on the state of
being dependent. It is likely to be concrete.

**Enhance** is to add something (more functionality, more ability, more
option).

improvement of what was already there.

## shameful \| shameless

**Shameless** means pretty much what you’d expect: that someone should feel
shame at something, but doesn’t.

***Shameful*** can have two meanings that almost seem like antonyms, but
they’re not, depending on whether it’s applied to a person or an act. If it’s
applied to a person, it generally means that they feel remorse. If it’s applied
to an act, it means that whoever is performing the action should feel shame.
However, it’s often used to emphasize that the person *should* feel shame, but
*doesn’t*. In this latter sense, it can almost seem like ***shameful*** means
the same thing as ***shameless***.

## compose \| comprise \| contain

**Comprise**&mdash;to be made up of; to consist of (especially a comprehensive
list of parts).

**Contain**&mdash;to hold inside (transitive).

***Comprise*** says that the list you are giving is exhaustive. All the steps
are explicitly indicated, and there are no missing steps. ***Contain*** does
not guarantee either of these.

Don’t say ~~*the method is comprised of X*~~.

You can say:

> *the method **comprises** X.*

or

> *the method **consists of** X.*


***Compose of*** is even more formal than *consist of* and *comprise*.

***Compose of*** is only used in the passive voice:

> *Muscle is **composed** of different types of protein.*

## contain \| include

***Contains*** is used when there is something else that is doing the
containing. The box is a container, and contains the hats. You would not,
generally, say that the box includes the hats. Inside the box is a set of
objects, and that set (which *contents* refers to) includes (and consists of)
the hats.

***Includes*** is also often used when talking about the features of a product
or thing for sale. If I were selling you the box, I might tell you that it
includes three hats. In this case, I’m not pointing out that the hats are
inside the box, but rather that the box and the hats are all part of the set of
things I’m offering to sell.

| Extra           | Additional       |
|-----------------|------------------|
| informal        | formal           |
| casual language | business setting |

**Extra**:

- Beyond what is due, usual, expected, or necessary; additional; supernumerary;
  also, extraordinarily good; superior; as, extra work; extra pay.
- Something in addition to what is due, expected, or customary; something in
  addition to the regular charge or compensation, or for which an additional
  charge is made; as, at European hotels lights are extras.

***Additional*** means a number has been added to the basic number.

***Extra*** often means beyond what is necessary or needed. ***Additional*** room may
be needed; *extra* room may never be used. Compare these to *spare*. A spare tire
or a spare room may never be used, but they have the specific purpose of being
available in an emergency. Often when something is *extra* you get rid of it.

The noun ***disturbance*** can be countable or uncountable. In more general,

***Accuracy*** is close to a known value; ***precision*** measures
repeatability.

In the fields of science and engineering, the **accuracy** of a measurement
system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that
quantity’s true value. The **precision** of a measurement system, related to
reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements
under unchanged conditions show the same results. Although the two words
***precision*** and ***accuracy*** can be synonymous in colloquial use, they
are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.

## essentially \| substantially

**Substantially** = considerably.

### Patents

***Essentially*** should be avoided at all costs unless you are trying to convey

ending up littering your translation with necessary features, which once again
has a significant impact on the scope of protection. If in doubt, go with
***substantially***.

## on \| onto

We use **onto** to:

- Talk about direction or movement to a position on a surface, usually with a
  verb that expresses movement:

  > *The cat climbed **onto** the roof.*

  > *She emptied the suitcase full of clothes **onto** the floor.*

- Describe movement towards an end position along a road or river:

  > *The path leads **onto** the main road.*

We use ***on*** or ***onto*** with very little difference in meaning to refer
to attachment or movement of something to something else. ***Onto*** gives a
stronger feeling of movement:

> *There's a battery pack with the camera that you can clip **onto** a belt.*

> *You can save the data **onto** your hard disk.*

## company name

- Unlike in Russian (JSC Rusal or whatever), the company type always follows
  the company name&mdash;whether Corporation, Limited, or any other type.
- We should not use the definite article before the firm or company unless the
  article is the part of the company’s name.
- If the word *company* is not part of the official name, then using the word
  *company* after the official name technically makes the official name an
  adjective that serves to qualify the real noun, which is the word *company*.
  In this case, you need the definite article, as in *I like working for the
  Cool\_Dude.com company*. I would rather say, *I like working for
  Cool\_Dude.com*, but I can imagine some situations where I want to clarify
  that I am talking about a company.

## starting from \| starting with

***Starting with*** A includes only words that start with the letter A.

> *Please give me all the names **starting with** A.*

***Starting from*** A gives you all the words that start with A and all the
words that start with the letters after A.

> *Let’s start cutting back on our expenses, **starting with/from** the money
  we spend on food.*

They can be used interchangeably if there is no order to what is being started
with/from, though ***with*** is more correct in my opinion. When order matters,
***starting from*** includes all items starting with and coming after.

## translate into \| translate to

- When you speak about the target language of translation, the usual
  preposition is ***into***:

  > *She translated the text **into** German.*

- When pointing out that one phrase is a translation of another, i.e. when the
  target is a phrase rather than a language, ***to*** is used instead:

  > *“Good morning!” was translated **to** “Guten Morgen!”.*

- Both variants are common for the pattern *from a language (in)to another
  language*:

  > *She translated the text <ins>from</ins> English **into** German.*

  > *She translated the text <ins>from</ins> English **to** German.* (also possible)

While the variant with ***into*** is more common in English literature (and is
also usually the the variant described in dictionaries and therefore the more
recommendable variant for non-native speakers), the variant with ***to*** seems
to be more common on the Internet and in everyday usage.

- Note that when “language to language” is used as an adjective phrase, the
  situation is reversed, and only ***to*** is common:

  > *We need to prepare an English-**to**-French translation.*

***

## literature \| the literature

An article is not needed for a general use. When ***literature*** refers to a
specific collection of books, papers, etc., is related to a given subject, we
use ***the***.

## before \| till \| until

If A happens before B, A happens and then B happens. If A happens *until* B
happens, A would happen, but stop when B happens. ***Till*** is a shortened
version of ***until***.

> *I will leave home **before** sunrise at 04:15.*

> *I will not leave home **till/until** sunrise at 04:15.*

In the first example you leave the house any time up until 04:14 when it is
still dark.

In the second you leave no earlier than 04:15 when it starts to become light.

Note the different constructions with positive and negative statements.

## opposite \| opposite to

- As a noun, ***opposite*** may stand alone or be followed by the preposition
  *of*:

  > *Madeleine believes just the **opposite**!*

  > *What is the **opposite** of up?*

- As an adjective, ***opposite*** may stand alone or be followed by the
  preposition to *or* occasionally *from*:

  > *The cars were travelling in **opposite** directions when the accident
    occurred.*

  > *Hyacinth’s opinions are often **opposite** to Pierre’s.*

  > *Keith’s cottage is on the same lake but on the **opposite** side from (or
    to) ours.*

- ***Opposite*** may also function as a preposition. The preposition
  ***opposite*** should not be followed by *of* or *to*:

  > *Jean-Luc lives in the house **opposite** ours.*

  > *Two dozen condos will be built **opposite** the theatre* (not ~~*opposite
    of the theatre*~~ or ~~*opposite to the theatre*~~).

## residual \| residue \| residues

The noun ***residue*** can be countable or uncountable. In more general,
commonly used, contexts, the plural form will also be residue. However, in more
specific contexts, the plural form can also be ***residues*** e.g. in reference
to various types of residues or a collection of residues.

***Residual*** is a derived term of *residue*. As nouns the difference is that
**residue** is whatever remains after something else has been removed while
**residual** is a remainder left over at the end of some process.

## what \| which

If you are trying to make a choice, ***what*** is used to ask when there is an
unknown number or infinite possibilities for an answer.

***Which*** is used if you are choosing between a more limited number of items,
already defined.

> ***Which** shoes should I wear with this dress?*

Often **which** or **what** can be used for several choices, depending on what
is in the speaker’s mind:

*(a) "**Which** bus goes into the centre?"*

*(b) "**What** bus shall I take?"*

Both sentences are fine. The speaker is probably thinking about fewer buses in
sentence (a) than in sentence (b).

## drag \| lift \| thrust

Four Forces Affect Things That Fly:

**Weight** is the force of gravity. It acts in a downward
direction&mdash;toward the center of the Earth.

**Lift** is the force that acts at a right angle to the direction of motion
through the air. Lift is created by differences in air pressure.

**Thrust** is the force that propels a flying machine in the direction of
motion. Engines produce thrust.

**Drag** is the force that acts opposite to the direction of motion. Drag is
caused by friction and differences in air pressure.

This question seeks out any and all persons who can respond, any number
of people.

***Anybody*** is sometimes considered inappropriate for formal conversations,

## independent of \| ~~independently from~~ \| independently of

~~***Independently from***~~ is not correct usage, as well as being very

neither of which applies here, since independence does not come or go from
something.

***Independent*** is an adjective that defines a noun:

> *Something is **independent** of ...*

***Independently*** is an adverb that defines a verb:

## whether \| whether or not

The *or not* portion of ***whether or not*** is often unnecessary and can be
removed, but sometimes it is essential. ***Whether or not*** should be used
when one’s response is the same, regardless of the outcome.
Conversely, ***whether*** should be used by itself to indicate only that the
outcome itself is undetermined.

> *I am not sure **whether or not** I can attend.* = I am not sure whether I
  can attend.

> *I will be there **whether or not** I am prepared.*

When ***whether*** means *if*, use one word. To decide which you should use, replace ***whether or not*** with *if* and *regardless of whether* and see which one makes sense. If the sentence doesn’t make sense with *if*, you should use ***whether or not***.

## information about \| information of \| information on

**Information on** something would be information that is really in-depth, and

is a kind of summary about a subject i.e. a brochure will contain *information

## in the photo \| in the picture \| on the postcard \| on the screen

If you are talking about the subject of the picture, use ***in***:

> *The boy **in** the picture is smiling.*

> *The boy **in** the photograph is walking on the sand.*

It seems simply wrong to talk about a person, or an object, ~~*on*~~ the
photograph.

If you are talking about the picture as a piece of paper/canvas/etc.,
use ***on***:

> *Spilling water **on** the picture will ruin it.*

It would be different talking about a postcard, because the picture/photograph
is, itself, on the postcard. So if the photograph of the boy on the beach was
printed as a postcard&mdash;or a greeting card of any kind&mdash;then he would
be the boy on the card.

> *The boy **in** the photograph on the card.*

Photo takes precedence over paper. We always speak of things in the picture/in
the photo, regardless of the medium (paper, digital image, etc.) I would say
***on** the computer screen* because it is the medium for displaying an image.

> *The boy **in** the image on the computer screen.*

If that image had been painted on canvas (or on a wall):

> *The boy in the picture and **on** the canvas (**on** the wall).*

## separated by \| separated with

***By*** marks an agent phrase:

***With*** marks an instrumental phrase:

> *The fighters were finally **separated with** a crowbar.*

When you’re talking about metaphoric separation you have the option of treating
the *separator* either as an agent itself, or as a tool (of another agent).

The agent interpretation:

> *The entries are **separated by** commas.*

The instrument interpretation:

> *The entries were **separated with** commas.*

*A typewriter* is an instrument, but *a ghostwriter* is a human, and therefore
an agent.

In most cases ***by*** and ***with*** are interchangeable, yet it could vary in
cases like:

> *I **smell with** my nose.*

> ~~*I smell by my nose.*~~

One of the interchangeable cases is:

> *This is **indicated by** a green light*.

> *This is **indicated with** a green light*.

If you are writing documentation for your application, use the correct word for
readability:

> *This should be **instantiated by** passing the arguments A, B and C.*

> *They should be **separated by** a comma.*

your main statement does not apply to:

> *Anything, **except** water, is likely to block a sink.*

**Except for**&mdash;you are mentioning something that prevents a statement
from being completely true:

> *The classroom was silent, **except for** the sound of pens on paper.*

## salary \| wages

**Wage**&mdash;the employee remuneration based on the number of hours worked,
multiplied by an hourly rate of pay.

**Salary**&mdash;the remuneration of an agreed annual amount, paid at agreed
intervals (i.e., monthly or fortnightly). This arrangement is essentially
outcome and task focused rather than being focused on working a set number of
hours.

## competition \| contest

***Contest*** suggests playing a game for the game’s sake just to see who would
win, or maybe playing for candy. But ***competition*** suggests playing the
game in order to get some big reward, where the reward and the achievement is
the only thing that is important, and there may be no pleasure in the game.

## answer \| reply \| response

***Response*** is a very broad term, and includes all reactions to a stimulus.

**Answer** is more specifically a response to a direct question.

One can always ***respond*** to anything (an event, an injury, a letter, a
speech, a question\...) but one can only ***answer*** a question. It’s possible
to respond to a question without actually answering it; listen to politicians
being interviewed.

***Reply*** normally refers to words or some other form of communication.
***Response*** could be words or it could be actions. ***Reply*** is a subset
of ***response***.

> *I asked for his name, and he **replied**, "Bob".*

> *I asked for his name, and he **responded**, "Bob".*

Someone can have a ***response*** to a stimulus, which might be a ***reply***:

> *James pricked Carol with a pin. Carol slapped James, **in reply**.*

The wince is a ***response***, and not a ***reply***:

> *James pricked Carol with a pin. Carol winced with pain.*

A ***reply*** has to go back to the source of the stimulus of the response,
e.g. a reply letter is written to someone who has written to you. A
***response*** does not have to go back.

If the stimulus for your ***response*** did not come from an agent that you
have anthropomorphized, then it is not a ***reply***. So you do not get replies
from machines, but you can get replies from companies. You can get
***responses*** from both.

> *I am moving my mouse but the pointer is not **responding**.*

> *I switched the key in the ignition, but got no **response**.*

## cost \| price

**Cost** is typically the expense incurred for creating a product or service a
company sells. The amount of cost that goes into producing a product can
directly impact its price and profit earned from each sale.

**Price** is the amount a customer is willing to pay for a product or service.
The difference between price paid and costs incurred is profit.

## regime \| regimen \| regiment

The noun **regime** primarily refers to a form of government or a period of
time that a person or governing body is in power. (In contemporary usage,
regime commonly carries a negative connotation.) Far less often, regime is used
as a synonym for ***regimen***.

The noun **regimen** primarily refers to a systematic plan, in particular a
regulated system of diet and exercise or a prescribed course of medical
treatment. Far less often, regimen is used as a synonym for ***regime*** (a
form of government), a usage that most dictionaries identify as *rare* or
*archaic*.

The noun **regiment** primarily refers to a military unit or any large group of
people. (Though regiment was once regarded as a synonym for ***regime***, most
dictionaries identify that usage as *archaic* or *obsolete*.)

As a verb, **regiment** means to organize a group of people in a systematic or
oppressive manner.

## decrease \| reduce

**Reduce** is to bring down the size, quantity, quality, value or intensity of
something; to diminish, to lower, to impair.

**Decrease** is of a quantity, to become smaller.

***

## gain \| profit

***Profit*** and ***gain*** are two terms that should be distinguished
correctly as these have very different meanings in accounting.

**Profit** is the summation of total income less total expenses. It is
generated within the usual business operations. It is the actual earnings of
the company. This is an indication of the financial robustness of the business.

**Gain** is the proceeds received from the sale of fixed or financial assets.
It is generated outside of business operations.

## sniffing \| snooping \| spoofing

***Sniffing*** and ***snooping*** should be synonyms. They refer to listening
to a conversation. For example, if you login to a website that uses no
encryption, your username and password can be sniffed off the network by
someone who can capture the network traffic between you and the web site.

**Spoofing** refers to actively introducing network traffic pretending to be
someone else. For example, spoofing is sending a command to computer A
pretending to be computer B. It is typically used in a scenario where you
generate network packets that say they originated by computer B while they
really originated by computer C.

**Spoofing** in an email context means sending an email pretending to be
someone else.

## class \| lesson

In both the UK and the US, **a class** is usually a group of students who are
learning together:

> *Jill and I were in the same **class** at primary school.*

You can also (especially in the US) use **class** to mean a group of students
who all completed their studies in a particular year:

> *Tim was in the **class** of 2005.*

**Class** can also mean a series of lessons in a particular subject:

> *She's taking a **class** in business administration.*

The usual British word for this is **course**:

> *A **course** in business administration*.

**Class** can also mean one of the periods in the school day when a
group of students are taught:

> *What time is your next class?*

British speakers also use ***lesson*** for this meaning, but American speakers
do not.

## check if \| check whether

***If*** and ***whether*** are often interchangeable, but sometimes using one
or the other will change the meaning of your sentence.

> *We want to know **if** you can come.*

> *We want to know **whether** you can come.*

> *Check his work and see **if** it is correct or not.*

> *Check his work and see **whether** it is correct or not.*

Use ***if*** when you have a conditional sentence and ***whether*** when
showing that two alternatives are possible.

> *Squiggly didn’t know whether Aardvark would arrive Friday or Saturday.* =
  There are two possibilities: Aardvark will arrive Friday, or Aardvark will
  arrive Saturday.

> *Squiggly didn’t know if Aardvark would arrive Friday or Saturday.* =
  Aardvark may not arrive at all.

## subject \| topic

**Topic**&mdash;a particular subject that you discuss or write about.

A ***topic*** defines a particular aspect that will be covered in conversation
or in any written form, whereas ***subject*** is used in context to a wider
aspect of knowledge and can be composed of various topics.

> *The **subject** of writing articles was the environmental issues, and
  various students came up with different topics on this particular subject
  matter.*

This is the reason that many times they are used interchangeably. They only
differ when the ***subject*** within the subject needs to be defined and then
the inner subject becomes the ***topic***.

## check \| check for \| check that \| validate \| verify

**Check** means to:

- consult;

- investigate;

- see if something (e.g., a machine) is in good condition or working properly:

  > *Have you **checked** the engine (over)?*

- see if something (e.g., a sum) is correct or accurate:

  > *Will you **check** my addition?*

**Check for**&mdash;verify the existance of something:

> *Please **check** my card; it may contain spelling mistakes.* (\= review it, examine it, correct it)

> *Please **check for** my card; I mailed it two days ago.* (\= look for it, see if the card has arrived yet)

**Check that**&mdash;to make sure.

**Verify**&mdash;to confirm the truth or correctness of (something):

> *Can you **verify** her statement?*

***Verify*** implies a positive conclusion was reached, whereas ***check***
just means something was investigated with no indication of the outcome.

**Validate**:

- Make legally valid (ratify).

- Grant official sanction to by marking:

  > ***Validate** a passport.*

## validation \| verification

### IT

**Verification**&mdash;a test of a system to prove that it meets all its
specified requirements at a particular stage of its development.

**Validation**&mdash;an activity that ensures that an end product stakeholder’s
true needs and expectations are met.

***Verification*** refers to a testing protocol (that uses any methodology)
that can determine if the software meets the specifications or requirements as
they were initially designed. The process has as its goal answering the
question: *Did I build what I said I would?* The verification of development
refers to checking an application that is still being developed to ensure that
it adheres to these specifications. The verification process can include
activities like code reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections. Actual testing of
the software is not required for verification.

***Validation*** is performed upon the completion of a module, or the entire
application. Validation focuses on ensuring that a stakeholder gets the product
they desired. Validation is high-level testing and typically consists of
regression testing, user testing, performance testing, and similar activities.

***Verification*** has little or no code execution, while ***validation***
requires code execution.

***Verification*** is a static method of checking documents and files, while
***validation*** is the dynamic process of testing the real product.

## stop + -ing \| stop to + infinitive

We use the ***-ing*** form after stop to indicate that an action or event is no
longer continuing:

> *It’s **stopped raining**. Let’s go for a walk.*

We use the ***to-infinitive*** after stop to indicate that someone stops doing
something in order to do something else:

  travelling, then we stopped our journey in order to look at the castle.)

**Require**&mdash;need.

> *I **require** (need) another cup of coffee. I will **request** (ask for) one

forceful demand:

  driving license.*

***

## big \| large

***Big*** can refer to the physical size of an object, but it also means that
something is serious or important, while ***large*** only refers to the
physical size. They can only be used with countable nouns:

> *a **big** city*

> *a **large** company*

But not with uncountable nouns! Instead of saying ~~big traffic~~, say *a
lot of traffic.*

Use ***big*** in the following cases:

1. More than average (see ***large*** below):

   > *Our office is quite **big**.*

2. Very important:

   > *This is a **big** decision.*

3. Successful:

   > *Milan is a **big** fashion hub.*

4. Powerful:

   > *There was a **big** earthquake yesterday.*

5. Of a large degree:

   > *She is a **big** fan of that movie.*

   > *People of our generation are **big** social media users.*

6. Older (informal):

   > *Have you met my **big** brother yet?*

7. With fixed phrases:

   - big fish

   - big deal

   - The Big Apple

   - to think big, etc.

Use ***large*** in the following cases:

1. More than average. Same meaning as ***big***, but more formal:

   > *The town was quite **large** with lots of business buildings.*

2. With quantity words:

   - a large area

   - a large volume

   - a large part of

   - to a large extent

   - a large amount

   - on a large scale

   - a large number of

   - a large quantity of

   - a large proportion

   - a large percentage of

3. Body sizes. Following the convention, clothing sizes are Small (S), Medium
   (M) and Large (L). In very rare occasions will you see Big (B) instead.
   Calling someone *fat* or *chubby* does not sound nice to anyone’s ears, so
   in most cases, it is better to leave it out and not mention it. However, if
   you really need to describe someone and you have to mention their
   *largeness*, it sounds nicer to say ***large*** than anything else.

   > *Please, go talk to the chairman of the conference, he’s super nice and
     helpful. If you don’t know him, he is the **large** man in the navy suit.*

4. With fixed phrases:

   - ***At large***:

     - Free, not captured yet:

       > *The police haven’t caught the thief yet; he is still **at large**.*

     - In general:

       > *There has been a loss of community values in society **at large**.*

   - ***By and large*** (in general, overall):

     > ***By and large**, the company has been very good to me over the last
       couple of years.*

   - ***Larger than life***:

     - A person that attracts special attention because of their flamboyant
       appearance or behavior:

       > *I’ve always thought that the marketing manager seemed **larger than
         life**.*

     - Something that seems disproportionately important:

       > *Your problems always seem **larger than life** at that time of
         night.*

considered \| considered as
---------------------------

***Considered as*** construction is almost always redundant. If you use
***considered*** to describe what people think of someone or something, you
simply don’t need *as*.

## comma use with if necessary \| if required \| when needed, etc.

At the start of a sentence, use a comma after ***if necessary \| if
needed \| when required \| where needed*** \| etc.

> ***If necessary**, I can stay up late to complete the work.*

Normally, you don’t need a comma in mid-sentence or at the end of the
sentence:

> *I will help you **if needed**.*

However, use commas to set off these expressions if they interrupt the
sentence flow or provide an explanatory note:

> *Use disposable gloves, **when required**, before handling food.*

> *The British army needs women and men who are willing to fight for their
  country, **if necessary**.*

***affirm*** is mainly positive:

> *Serving in the defense services **affirms** your loyalty to the nation.*

## bound to \| bound with

***Bind to*** is used to describe the action of tying or attaching an object to
another object:

> *Take the knife, and **bind** it **to** your leg.*

***Bind with*** is used to describe the thing which is used to tie or attach
the object:

> *I will **bind** the knife with a rope.*

One is used with the object the action is performed upon, and the other
is used with the object performing the action.

There is a range of idiomatic uses and similar phrasal verbs.

The outcome was inevitable. **To** might be seen as part of the infinitive to
fail, certainly it needs to be followed by a verb in infinitive form:

> *He was **bound to** fail.*

A complex or ongoing relationship between the outcome (failure), and some other
factor (his preconceptions):

> *His failure was **bound** up **with** his preconceptions.*

## I have got \| I have gotten

In UK English, ***have got*** is the only grammatical possibility. In US
English, there is no situation where you could grammatically substitute one for
the other without changing the meaning.

In general, ***have got*** is the present perfect form of *to get* in UK
English, while ***have gotten*** is the US English version.

However, even in US English, ***have got*** is used in certain instances,
namely to mean present tense have (in the sense of possession, or to mean
must):

> *I **have got** a lot of friends.* (=I have a lot of friends)

> *I **have got to** go now.* (=I have to go now/I must go now)

***Gotten*** is probably the most distinctive of all the AmE/BrE grammatical
differences, but British people who try to use it often get it wrong. It is not
simply an alternative for ***have got***. ***Gotten*** is used in such contexts
as

> *They’ve **gotten** a new boat.* (= obtain)

> *They’ve **gotten** interested.* (= become)

> *He’s **gotten** off the chair.* (= moved)

But it is not used in the sense of possession (= have). AmE does not allow

> *I’ve **gotten** the answer.*

> *I’ve **gotten** plenty.*

but uses *I’ve got* as in informal BrE.

The availability of ***gotten*** does however mean that AmE can make such
distinctions as the following:

> *They’ve **got** to leave* (they must leave)

> *They’ve **gotten** to leave* (they’ve managed to leave).

***

## divide \| separate

**Separate**&mdash;to take apart / keep apart:

> ***Separate** the wheat from the chaff.*

***Separate*** implies that the things in question are being separated by some
property of those things. For example, I might separate my white shirts from
the rest of my clothes and wash them separately with bleach, or I might
separate the power cords and data cords when reorganizing the tangled mess of
wires under my desk.

***Divide*** implies that the things in question are being divided into certain
quantities. For example, I might divide my laundry into baskets/loads, or I
might divide my pizza into equal portions for everyone in the room. This is
consistent with the mathematical concept of division.

Often means there is intent in making the disaggregation.

## dummy \| fake \| mock \| stub

***Dummy*** objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are
just used to fill parameter lists.

***Fake*** objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some
shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is
a good example).

***Stubs*** provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not
responding at all to anything outside what’s programmed in for the test. Stubs
may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that
remembers the messages it "sent", or maybe only how many messages it "sent".

***Mocks*** are objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a
specification of the calls they are expected to receive. A mock is not setup in
a predetermined way so you have code that does it in your test. Mocks in a way
are determined at runtime since the code that sets the expectations has to run
before they do anything.

## package \| packet \| parcel

A **parcel** or **package** is an object or group of objects wrapped in paper,
that can be carried somewhere or sent by post. The two words have almost
exactly the same meaning in British English, but a ***parcel*** usually has a
more regular shape than a ***package***:

> *Charities sent **parcels** of food and clothes to the refugees.*

> *I am taking this **package** to the post office.*

In American English, ***package*** is usually used rather than ***parcel***.

In British English, a **packet** is a small container in which a quantity of
something is sold. Packets are either small boxes made of thin cardboard, or
bags or envelopes made of paper or plastic.

## replace by \| replace with

If you are referring to replacing something that is broken, old, or not

> *They **communicated** in sign language.*

***Communicate to***: if you communicate information, a feeling, or an
idea to someone, you let them know about it:

> *They successfully **communicate** their knowledge **to** others.*

## experience \| an experience \| experiences

*Countable*: an event or incident. It is an event that you were a part of and
the event made an impression on you (it’s something you will remember). These
type of experiences are countable, just like events.

> *Climbing Mount Everest was an **experience** that I’ll never forget.*

> *I have had some bad **experiences** with taxi drivers.*

*Uncountable*: familiarity. You have used computers for many years, so you are
familiar with them, you have knowledge of them, and you have skill using them:

> *I have 8 years of teaching **experience**.*

## ~~in free time~~ \| in my free time

*Time* is a countable noun in this case because it is specified and all

## people’s lives \| peoples’ lives \| people’s life \| in the lives of people

The rule here is you should always have an S with one-word possessives (*car’s*
(belonging to the car), *dog’s* (of the dog), *Amy’s*) and you should ONLY put
the apostrophe after the *s* if two conditions are met:

- The noun that is possessing is plural (if it belongs to the cars, the dogs,
  or the women)

- The plural noun ends in *s*:

> *The cars’ steering wheels.*

> *The dogs’ bowls.*

> *The women’s spouses.*

The culture of the singular people:

> *The people’s culture.*

The culture belonging to several peoples:

> *The peoples’ culture.*

A movement that belongs to ALL of the people:

> *The people’s movement.*

Movements belonging to each individual:

> *The people’s movements.*

***People’s lives*** would refer to a condition that affects a group in
general:

> ***People’s lives** can be destroyed by sudden climatic events.*

You would use an article with ***people’s life*** and it is restrictive in
that it refers to a more specific group, like a tribe or a race:

> *The **people’s life** changed for the better when they found a closer source
  of water.*

If you want to identify the people specifically as being alive and breathing,
then you’d say ***people’s lives*** (what we usually say). If you only want to
accentuate the life itself, and you’re not really considering the people to be
an important part of the idea, then you’d say ***in the lives of people***
(sounds rather strange, but it’s not actually "wrong" in any real sense).

## people \| peoples \| Peoples \| persons

***Persons*** is especially associated with its use in legal language, in which
it’s often used rather than people to ensure clarity by emphasizing that the
text is referring to multiple individuals, as opposed to a group as a whole:

> *Occupancy is limited to 200 **persons**.*

> *Any person or **persons** found to be in violation of these rules shall be
  prohibited from participating.*

When ***persons*** is used in this way outside of legal texts, it has
historically been regarded as overly formal or stilted.

***Persons*** is sometimes used with terms related to identity to emphasize
individuality, such as saying *Jewish persons* instead of *Jewish people*.

Regardless of intent, though, statements that are made about individuals with a
common identity can lead to overgeneralization or stereotyping, so it’s always
best to consider whether the individuals’ common identity is an essential part
of what you’re trying to say. Choosing how to refer to people can also be
informed by preferences around language that’s *person-first* (as in
*person with autism*) or identity-first (as in *autistic person*).

The word ***peoples*** is specifically used as the plural of people in its
sense as a collective singular noun referring to a nation, or tribe, or other
community:

> *the many **peoples** of the world*

Capitalization is increasingly used as a form of respect and distinction for
terms that relate to identity (specific, distinct communities):

> *Indigenous **Peoples***

> *Hispanic **Peoples***

## progress \| ~~a progress~~ \| the progress

When we refer to the ways in which society in general goes forward and improves
itself, we use progress without ***the***:

> ***Progress** will only happen when people begin to understand that every
  individual has a responsibility to play their part.*

> *~~The progress will only~~ ...*

***Progress*** is a mass noun and cannot be regarded as a count noun, except in
an archaic form:

> Religious processions and royal **progresses** have been an important
  practice in the Indian subcontinent.

## requirement for \| requirement of \| requirement on \| requirement to

***Requirement on*** a person or something that is required to do something:

> *The second element is a new **requirement on** private landlords to check tenants’ immigration status.*

> *The **requirement on** the ECB[^ecb] is to keep inflation below but close to 2 per cent.*

[^ecb]: ECB = European Central Bank

***Requirement of*** a person or something that has required someone to do something:

> *Pain tolerance is an essential **requirement of** his profession.*

***Requirement for*** something that is required:

> *Water is a fundamental **requirement for** life.*

## cover by \| cover in \| cover with

The meanings are very similar, and these three prepositions can be used almost
interchangeably:

> *The mountain is **covered with/in/by** snow.*

When referring to a substance that sticks to another, use ***in*** or
***with***, but not ***by***:

> *The actress was **covered in** blood.*

> *The actress was **covered with** blood.*

> ~~*The actress was **covered by** blood.*~~

> *The ribs were **covered with** sauce.*

> *The ribs were **covered in** sauce.*

> ~~*The ribs were **covered by** sauce.*~~

When referring something that physically protects something else, use
***with*** or ***by***, but not ***in***:

> *The field was **covered with** a tarp.*

> *The field was **covered by** a tarp.*

> ~~*The field was **covered in** a tarp.*~~

Use ***covered with*** to indicate an unusual amount of something on top of
something else; use ***covered by*** to connote a covering so dense that the
object being covered is completely obscured from view:

> *The mountain was **covered with** fog.*

> *The mountain was **covered by** fog.*

> *Our grass was **covered with** butterflies.*

> *Our grass was **covered by** butterflies.*

When talking about metaphorical coverage, use ***covered by***:

> *The roof damage was **covered by** insurance.*

> ~~*The roof damage was **covered with** insurance.*~~

> ~~*The roof damage was **covered in** insurance.*~~

> *The city council meeting was **covered by** the news station.*

## duty \| responsibility

- **Duty** is a moral commitment to something or someone, whereas
  **responsibility** is a condition of being responsible.
- As ***duty*** refers to moral commitment, it denotes an active feeling for
  doing something.
- In case of ***duty***, the person will be involved in activity without any
  self-interest.
- **Responsibility** can be termed as an ability to act at one’s own will,
  without any supervision. It is the obligation to successfully complete an
  assigned task.
- In ***responsibility***, a person is solely responsible for the entire task
  and its outcome. It is the responsibility of the parents to give good
  education to their children.
- Once a person engages himself with some ***duty*** or if he has been
  entrusted with a duty, then that person fully commits himself to it.

[*Source*](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-duties-and-responsibilities/)

***

## job \| work

***Work*** is both a verb and a noun, whereas ***job*** is only a noun.

**Job** refers to a particular employment role or position, such as cook,
teacher or banker, whereas **work** refers in a more general way to activities
that you do.

All ***jobs*** involve ***work*** but doing work isn’t always part of a job.
For example, someone can spend the weekend working in their garden. However,
this is a free time activity, and so it is not his or her job.

If you describe how a machine ***works***, you explain how it functions:

> *Can someone show me how the photocopier **works**?*

> *Don’t try to use that computer. It doesn’t **work**.*

**Job** can also refer to a specific task that requires ***work*** and a task
that you can specifically identify:

> *I have a few **jobs** to do at home this weekend. I need to paint my
  bedroom, fix a broken door and cut the grass.*

> *The **work** that I do in my **job** is very interesting, so even though it
  is hard work, I don't think I will look for another **job**!*

> *Are you a student or do you have a **job**? Whatever you do, is it hard
  **work**?*

## part \| a part

Both ***part*** and ***a part*** can be used to refer to a discrete countable
thing:

> *We teach several skills. Dancing is **part** of what we teach.*

> *We teach several skills. Dancing is **a part** of what we teach.*

Both ***part*** and ***a part*** can be used to refer to a more general portion
of a thing that is not countable:

> ***Part** of the food* \[or money, or care\] *will be devoted to the poor.*

> ***A part** of the food* \[or money, or care\] *will be devoted to the poor.*

The portion to be devoted is not defined in these sentences as comprising a
specific discrete section or item, but either construction is clear and
appropriate. The addition of the article a may give a slight connotation that
the portion may already be determined, but not necessarily.

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/117833/a-part-vs-part?noredirect=1)

***

## dedicated \| devoted

**Devoted**&mdash;commitment to a particular activity or object. It’s
particularly used to talk about someone’s love for their family:

> *He’s a **devoted** father.*

> *She was **devoted** to her grandchildren.*

We can use it, perhaps less frequently, to talk about other areas of life:

> *Years of devoted research finally produced results.*

> *The teachers were devoted to their students.*

The central meaning is that effort and concentration are involved in the object
of the devotion. And it’s worth noting that the noun **devotions** might also
mean religious activities like praying.

***Dedicated*** is a more general word. If you are dedicated to something, you
believe that it’s right and worthwhile and you give a lot of time and effort to
it. It’s especially useful to talk about someone’s attitude to their job:

> *A **dedicated** worker*

> *A **dedicated** vegetarian* (believes very strongly that people should not
  eat animals)

> *A song on the radio might be **dedicated** to a particular person.*

**Dedication**&mdash;a statement which says who a book has been written for or
who a song has been sung for.

***

## host \| node

Every network ***host*** is a physical network ***node*** (i.e. a network
device), but not every physical network node is a host. Network devices such as
modems, hubs and network switches are not assigned host addresses (except
sometimes for administrative purposes), and are consequently not considered to
be network hosts. Devices such as network printers and hardware routers have IP
addresses, but since they are not general-purpose computers, they are sometimes
not considered to be hosts.

| notion | definition                                                           |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| node   | a device that implements IPv6                                        |
| router | a node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly addressed to itself |

## provide \| provide for \| provide with

***Provide***: the result/outcome is the direct object:

> *A house **provides** shelter.*

> *My job **provides** income.* (= My job provides me with income.)

***Provide with*:** *provide* is followed by an indirect object. **Providing**
(someone) **with** something means to give something wanted or needed:

> *Room to Read **provides** girls **with** scholarships that cover the cost of
  housing, food, and books.*

In this sentence, *girls* is the indirect object and *scholarships* is the
direct object.

**Provide for**, in general, means to make whatever is necessary for someone
available to him or her. We often use this expression when we talk about
parents providing for their family:

> *She says changes such as migration away from rural areas are allowing more
  women to find work and **provide for** their families.*

**Provide for** can mean *prepare for*:

> *The architect **provided for** the possibility of storms by strengthening
  the abutments.*

> ~~*The architect **provided** the possibility of storms by strengthening the
  abutments*~~ (= stronger abutments are somehow supposed to invoke storms).

## em dash \| en dash \| hyphen \| minus \| three-em dash \| two-em dash

***Дефис*** (hyphen, -) употребляют в середине слова:

- в составных словах:

  > *three-em dash*

  > *off-white shirt*

- для обозначения переносов

- для отделения корней от префиксов и суффиксов:

  > *co-worker*

- в названиях:

  > *Tay-Sachs disease*

***Минус*** (minus, −) может быть немного длиннее дефиса. Употребляется для
обозначения отрицательного числа или операции вычитания. В зависимости от
шрифта можно заменить дефисом или коротким тире.

***Короткое тире*** (En dash, &ndash;) равно по ширине букве n в прописном или
строчном варианте, в зависимости от шрифта. В некоторых шрифтах может быть
длиннее или короче.

- обозначение диапазонов:

  > *June 18&ndash;20*

- акцент на контрасте или взаимоотношении между двумя объектами:

  > *New York&ndash;London flight*

  > *Radical&ndash;Unionist coalition*

  > *mother&ndash;daughter relationship*

- некоторые предпочитают заменять этим знаком длинное тире.

***Длинное тире*** (Em dash, &mdash;) равно по ширине букве *m* в прописном или
строчном варианте, а в некоторых шрифтах и длиннее. Если поставить рядом
несколько длинных тире, они образуют сплошную линию.

- вместо запятой, двоеточия или скобок. Разница в том, что длинное тире
  обозначает более длинную и выразительную интонационную паузу.

- отделение источника в цитатах:

  > *In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.*
   &mdash; Oscar Wilde

- в американском английском длинное тире не принято отделять пробелами от
  предшествующего слова:

  > *A flock of sparrows&mdash;some of them juveniles&mdash;alighted and sang.*

- иногда вместо длинного тире используют короткое тире с пробелом:

  > *A flock of sparrows &ndash; some of them juveniles &ndash; alighted and
    sang.*

**Двойное длинное тире** (two-em dash, &mdash;&mdash;) &mdash; два длинных
тире, поставленных рядом без пробела. Указывает, что часть слова опущена.
Обычно так обозначают имена либо ругательства:

> *Mr. L&mdash;&mdash; told Ms. T&mdash;&mdash; that he would be
  d&mdash;&mdash;d if he invited her out again.*

**Тройное длинное тире** (three-em dash, &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;) &mdash; три
длинных тире, поставленных рядом без пробела. Указывает, что опущено
(повторяющееся) слово. Особенно актуален этот знак для библиографий, где
тройное тире вместо имени автора означает, что автор тот же, что и для
предыдущего пункта в списке.

Правила не универсальны. Иногда в сложносоставных прилагательных употребляют
короткое тире вместо дефиса или не отделяют длинное тире от текста пробелами
даже в британском варианте английского.

## comma before a subordinate conjunction

A subordinate clause will not form a complete sentence. It will instead make a
reader want additional information to finish the thought. The examples of
subordinate conjunctions are ***after, although, as, because, before, even if,
even, though, if, in order that, once, since, so that, than, that, though,
unless***, etc.

The rule is to use a comma after the subordinate clause rather than before the
subordinate conjunction:

> *Jonathon spent his class time reading comic books since his average was a 45
  one week before final exams.*

> *Since Jonathon’s class average was a 45 one week before final exams, he
  spent his class time reading comic books.*

## interfere in \| interfere with

In the case of someone else's life, you can either ***interfere in*** or
**with**. The former is critical of the fact that you meddled at all. The
latter is critical of the results of your meddling.

To **interfere with** means to disrupt:

> *Wave patterns can **interfere with** each other* (they are mutually
  disruptive).

Whilst it’s true that ***interfering in*** someone else’s affairs may be
disruptive, it needn’t be. But if you ***interfere with*** their affairs,
you’re definitely having a bad influence. There’s also the idiomatic usage of a
paedophile ***interfering with*** a victim, which normally refers specifically

## amend \| emend \| mend

**Amend** defines the action of slightly changing some words in a document. It
is used a lot more frequently than ***emend*** and it is most likely to be
found in passive voice.

The meaning of ***emend*** is confined to textual alterations, and ***amend***
can be broadened to include the general improvement of other things. Still,
***amend*** is mostly used in the sense of improving text.

> *The contract has been **amended**, terms have slightly changed now.*

If you’re not a professional editor who specializes in proof-reading, than
you’ll probably never use or read ***emend*** in this form. ***Emend*** is
mostly present in contexts related to professional, technical writing and
editing, and it defines the action of improving a text through editing.

> *I hired a professional to **emend** my contract and make sure everything is
  alright before presenting it to the other parties.*

To **mend** something is to fix something that was broken or that had a
problem:

> *To **mend** a punctured tyre.*

> *To **mend** a broken heart.*

If you’re talking about fixing a rip in a shirt, you would be better to just
use the word ***mend***; to ~~**amend** the shirt~~ would sound strange. The
Constitution of the U.S. may be ***amended*** (as it has been) but if the
actual document itself were damaged and required restoration I don’t think
anyone would say the team that did the work amended the Constitution.

tool, weapon, or ornament of archaeological or historical interest.

**Artefact**&mdash;an artificial product or effect observed in a natural
system, especially one introduced by the technology used in scientific

Some verbs can be used with a gerund (***verb-ing***) or an infinitive (***to
\+ verb***), but the meaning changes. For example:

- ***Like***: can be used with both gerunds and infinitives without much change
  in meaning, however:

  - ***like + gerund***&mdash;you enjoy something:

    > *I **like going** on holiday.*

  - ***like + to + infinitive***&mdash;you want to say that you think it’s a
    good idea:

    > *I **like to go** to the dentist every 6 months.*

- ***Stop***:

  > *I **stopped working**.* (I was working, then I stopped)

  > *I **stopped to** answer the phone.* (This is the reason I stopped)

- ***Remember***:

  > *I’m sure I bought the milk&mdash;I **remember buying** it!* (I did it, and
    now I remember it&mdash;buy first, remember after!)

  > *Don’t worry&mdash;I **remembered to** buy the milk.* (I thought of it,
    then I did it&mdash;remember first, buy after!)

- ***Forget***:

  > *I’ll never **forget buying** my first car* (I did it, and I won’t forget
    it&mdash;buy first, (not) forget after)

  > *I **forgot to** buy the milk.* (I didn’t do it because I
    forgot&mdash;forget first, buy after)

- ***Try***:

  > *I couldn’t sleep, so I **tried drinking** warm milk.* (This was one
    possible way to achieve what I wanted)

  > *I **tried to** sleep, but the music was too loud.* (This is what I wanted
    to achieve, but it was difficult, and maybe I didn’t succeed)

- ***Need***:

  > *He **needs to** clean the toilet.* (Active, he should do it)

  > *The toilet **needs cleaning**.* (Passive, someone should do it&mdash;it
    should be done)

- ***Go on***:

  > *I **went on** working all night.* (I continued this)

  > *I was a teacher, but I **went on** to work as a journalist.* (This is what
    I did next)

- ***Mean***:

  > *I **mean to** learn Japanese one day.* (I plan to do this)

  > *Learning Japanese **means learning** to write kanji.* (It involves this)

## miss from \| miss in

**miss in**&mdash;something or somebody is lost within something. You suppose
that their existence is true, but their temporal or spatial position is
missing:

> ***Missing in** action*

> *What’s **missing in** your apartment?*

**Miss from**&mdash;something is lost entirely from its source, and whether or
not it was there to begin with is irrelevant.

> *Copy of check is **missing from** the file*

~~Missing in the file~~ doesn’t make sense because it’s *not* in the file. The
only use I can think of for ***missing in*** is when something (or someone)
goes missing:

> *John went **missing in** Paris.*

> *I **missed** that new car **in** the first version of this computer game so
  much.* (You obtained the first version of the game after you had already
  played version two. You regret going back to an older version.)

> *I **missed** that new car **from** the first version of this computer game
  so much.* (The car was in the first version but was absent from the second
  version.)

You can’t really miss something until you have it. You don’t say to a girl you
just met, *I’ve missed you all my life.* After you know her, and she goes away,
then you can miss her:

> *I **missed** you while you were on vacation.*

***

## lack \| miss

**Lack** something&mdash;to not have something (usually something desirable
or essential):

> *I would take the radio apart, but I **lack** a screwdriver.*

**Miss**&mdash;to regret the absence of something or someone:

> *I would take the radio apart but I have lost my screwdriver, it was a
  particularly good one and I **miss** it.*

> *My wife died three years ago and I still **miss** her. You ask if I **lack**
  a wife; I suppose I do but I have no desire to remarry.*

However, you can say, to be ***missing*** *something* = to ***lack*** because
of the loss of a previously owned object:

> *I would take the radio apart, but I am **missing** a screwdriver. I can’t
  find it anywhere, I must have lost it.*

***

## solution for \| solution of \| solution to

Generally we use ***to***:

> *We have the **solution to** all your problems.*

You can use ***solutions for*** when speaking of the recipient of the solution,
as opposed to linking a solution to a problem:

> *We have **solutions for** your family in your time of need.*

It depends on your use of the word *solution*:

> *What’s the **solution to** the problem?* (The answer to the problem)

> *He won £10,000 for the **solution of** the math problem.* (The solving of
  the problem)

In chemistry:

> *A **solution of** hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide.*

## connect to \| connect with

**Connected to** usually means a physical connection:

> *Symptoms **connected with** kidney stones*

## activity \| activities \| assignment \| drill \| exercise \| problem \| task

An **exercise** is a teaching procedure that involves controlled, guided or
open ended practice of some aspect of language. A ***drill***, a cloze
***activity***, a reading comprehension passage can all be regarded as
exercises.

Main characteristics of exercises:

- A language exercise is guided and controlled by the teacher.

- An exercise usually has a restrictive focus on a single language element, and
  has a linguistic outcome.

- The focus is usually on a single skill.

- There is no reference to the context.

- A language  exercise is not communicative and usually not authentic.

- It is not meaningful and the focus is on form rather than on content.

- Correction is usually done immediately.

**Drill and practice** is a disciplined and repetitious exercise, used as a
mean of teaching and perfecting a skill or procedure. Similar to memorization,
drill and practice involves repetition of specific skills, such as spelling or
multiplication.

The term **activity** refers to any kind of purposeful classroom procedure that
involves learners doing something that relates to the goals of the course. For
example singing a song, playing a game, taking part in a debate, having a group
discussion, are all different kinds of teaching activities.

Its plural form i.e. **activities** refer to an occupation or some kind of
outdoor activity.

A **task**:

1. *(A general definition)* A piece of work done as part of one’s duties. A
   task is usually done under the supervision of someone and needs to be
   completed on time. It requires focus and there’s always an intention
   associated with it. The main purpose of performing a task is to complete it
   in the given time duration.

2. A communicative act that, in the main, is meaning-based, goal-oriented, and
   purposeful with a non-linguistic and communicative outcome.

- Tasks are free. Students are given free will to use language for
  communicative purposes.

- Focus on multiple skills rather than on one.

- Tasks are used in context.

- Tasks are communicative and usually authentic.

- Tasks are meaningful and focus is on content.

- Correction of tasks is delayed and is done through observation and
  awareness raising.

***Task*** requires supervision and comes with a deadline and it cannot be left
incomplete while activity need not necessarily require supervision. The
***activity*** has no such deadline and it’s a continuous process. The primary
focus while doing a task is in completing it while the primary function in
performing an activity is in doing it.

An **assignment** is work given to you by your boss/coworker. ***Task*** could
be the same but it can also mean the work that you assigned to yourself.

A **problem** is a question proposed for solution or discussion. Problems have
many possible solutions and figuring out the right one for a given situation
allows for ownership of that solution. ***Tasks***, on the other hand, are a
known entity. There’s already a solution, and you only have to physically go
through the steps of completing it. There’s not much thought required, and if
the task popped up frequently enough, you’d consider automating it.

## boobs \| tits

Literally, **tits** refer to the nipples and **boobs** refer to the entire

## accidentally \| coincidentally \| coincidently \| incidentally

**Accidental** and **incidental** can both mean *something happening by
chance*, but usage suggests that ***accidental*** also implies an element of
carelessness or inattention while ***incidental*** implies the occurrence would
have happened with or without attention or care.

**Accident** and **incident** share the idea of a sudden and unpleasant
occurrence. ***Accident*** usually refers directly to something that causes
damage or injury, ***incident***&mdash;to a specific moment or instance of
unpleasantness or unlawfulness:

> *a traffic **accident***

> *isolated **incidents** were reported*

**Coincidentally** relates to luck, in a way, to two or more events at one time
apparently by mere chance:

> *You happen to call me on the phone. In the course of our conversation you
  happen to mention where you are. By luck (**coincidentally**), you happen to
  be very close to where I am and that will make it easy for me to meet up with
  you in person.*

***Coincidently*** is *simultaneously*.

***Incidentally*** is more like *by the way*:

> *By the way (**incidentally**), I am going to be out of town next weekend so
  I can’t go to the movies like we planned.*

## furthermore, however, moreover, therefore (punctuation)

1. At the beginning of a sentence: put a comma after these words (some modern
   writers are now dropping the comma).

   > ***Therefore**, we will proceed with the order.*

   > ***However**, we still have hope.*

   1.1. A traditional rule stated that ***however*** meaning *nevertheless*
        should not be used at the beginning of a sentence. Most style guides
        consider this rule old-fashioned.

2. Use a semicolon and comma to introduce a new independent clause (a group of
   words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.)

   > *She always meets her deadlines; **furthermore**, her work is good.*

   > *We plan to stay for another year; **however**, Peter is leaving now.*

   2.1. Some writers are now treating *however, therefore, moreover* and
        *furthermore* as conjunctions and just using a comma:
   
     > *We plan to stay for another year, **however** Peter is leaving now.*

   2.2. You can also use ***however*** as a conjunction to mean *by whatever
        means*:
   
     > *I don’t care **however** you do it, just get it done.*

3. As intensifiers or for emphasis:

   > *You can, **therefore**, do whatever you like.*

   > *The vegetables, **furthermore**, are good for you.*

## condition for \| condition of

IEEE Definitions

**Failure**: External behavior is incorrect

> *I want to **learn to** speak French.* = *I want to **learn how to** speak

> *He **learned how to** obey.*

> *He **learned to** obey.* = He learned that he must obey.

***

## error \| mistake

**Mistake**&mdash;a decision which brought unsuccessful results:

> *Her decision to sell the house was a big **mistake**.*

A ***mistake*** is usually accidental, you know it is wrong. Otherwise, an
***error*** is usually made due to the lack of knowledge and is more formal and
technical than ***mistake***.

Machines never make ***mistakes***, but rather they make ***errors***. People
can make both.

The person who is making the ***error*** doesn’t know that he is doing
something wrong. For example, you do not understand some concepts in math, so
you make a lot of errors. Now, imagine a situation where you understand and
know the concepts, but you did the calculations in a rush. You had knowledge,
but it’s your carelessness that resulted in the mistakes.

## privilege \| right

### Law

A **right** is something that every person is born with and is inalienable,
which means that it cannot be given, taken away, or denied by anyone. Another
distinction between a right and a ***privilege*** is that a ***right*** does
not need to be earned or worked for. For example, free speech is a right
because anyone can speak freely and there is nothing anyone has to do to be
able to freely speak and it does not cost anyone else anything to have free
speech.

On the other hand, a driver’s license is a ***privilege*** because anyone that
wants to get one has to be a certain age, be free from limitations such as
being blind, and must pass a test first. This license can be denied or taken
away when a person does not meet the qualifications or violates the driving
laws.

***

## permission \| privilege

### General

**Permission**&mdash;authorization granted to do something; formal consent.

**Privilege**&mdash;a grant to an individual, corporation, etc., of a special
right or immunity, under certain conditions.

### IT

**Permission**&mdash;a rule associated with an object to regulate which users
can gain access to the object and in what manner. Permissions are assigned or
denied by the object’s owner.

**Privilege**&mdash;authorization to perform a specific action or set of
actions on a managed object or group of managed objects.

- ***Permissions*** are given to roles, ***privileges*** are given to people;

- A ***permission*** is asked for, a ***privilege*** is granted;

- ***Permissions*** are situation-based, ***privileges*** are time-based.

So typically, as used in IT security, privileges determine permissions. A user,
through their account, is granted the ***privilege*** of reading a particular
type of record (or a particular record) by the administrator of a system; this
is typically done once, or as needed over time. The application, acting on
behalf of the user who has authenticated themselves using the account, then
asks for ***permission*** to perform an action each and every time it must do
so, and the system grants this permission in each situation after examining the
privileges of the user.

## license \| permit

A **license** is a legally binding contract that allows someone or something to
do, own, perform an action or use a service as long as they agree to the
provided terms and conditions. Examples of licenses are driving licenses,
software licenses and business licenses. All these have terms and conditions
attached to them and must be followed for the license to be put to action.

A **permit** is an official document which gives an individual permission to
carry out an activity.

A person may have a driving ***permit*** before attaining a certain age, and
once that age is attained, a ***license*** is given. This is the same case for
a person who has a ***license*** to carry on pest control business but must
have a ***permit*** to store the chemicals.

### Differences between permits and licenses
                                                                                                    
#### Period of Validity

In most cases, ***licenses*** are permanent while ***permits*** are temporary.
For instance, in driving, a permit is valid for up to two years in most places
while licenses are permanent, although they can also be annulled in case of
misuse of the said license.

#### Different restrictions

***Licenses*** have few restrictions if any. On the other hand, ***permits***
have a lot of restrictions. ***Permits*** restrict on the time an activity can
be carried out, who is carrying out the activity, where the activity is being
carried out and also whether supervision is available. Most activities that are
carried out with the authority of a ***license*** do not have such
restrictions. For instance, a driver’s license does not have restrictions on
where, whom and when to drive, as long it is within the allowed territory.

#### Inspection periods

***Permits*** require regular safety regulation inspections from the relevant
authorities. ***Licenses***, on the other hand, may require inspection, but not
as regular.

#### Appearance

While appearance is mainly a non-issue, licenses and permits are in most cases
not similar. For instance, most ***permits*** may be a sticker but a
***license*** may be updated to a card.

## allow for \| allow of \| allow that \| allow to

**Allow** means:

- *permit* or *give permission*:

  > *I can’t **allow** you to go outside without a jacket.*

- fail to stop something from happening:
  
  > *The hermit **allowed** the grass to grow wild around the house and the
    yard.*

- admit (***allow that***[^allow_that]):
  
  > *The intern **allowed that** she was not the most experienced person to
    give the flu shots.*

**Allow for** means *make allowances for*[^make_allowances_for] or *consider
the possibility of something*.

[^allow_that]: allow that = допускать возможность того, что

[^make_allowances_for]: make allowances for = делать поправку на

> *The instructor **allowed for** the possibility that the students really did
  forget to bring their homework assignments to class.* = Although the
  instructor really believes that the students haven’t done the assignment, he
  is open to the possibility that they really did the work and just forgot to
  bring their assignments to class.

> *When we decided to go on a picnic, we didn’t **allow for** the chance that
  the rain would be as hard and continuous as it was.* = The friends didn’t
  consider the possibility that it would keep raining when they first made up
  their minds to go on a picnic.

**Allow of**[^allow_of] (permit) has never been common, and it has practically
disappeared today:

> *The evidence **allows of** the possibility of an inside job.*

[^allow_of]: Allow of = permit = делать возможным, допускать

We would not say that *the evidence ~~allows for~~ a possibility*, because
*evidence* is not a viable subject for that action; it is rather your
interpretation which must allow for possibilities.

## die by \| die from \| die of

**die of**: someone dies of a direct cause:

> *He **died of** cancer.*

**die from**: someone dies from an indirect cause:

> *He **died from** smoking.*

**die by**: someone dies by the means of something:

> *He **died by** a bullet.*

If you fell twenty stories, we might say that you ***died from*** falling, but
you ***died of*** massive trauma and bloodloss (caused by the fall).

Both *died of cancer* or *died from cancer* would probably be acceptable to an
English speaker.

When someone ***dies by** the sword*, for example, we don’t literally mean that
they died from a sword to the heart. Rather we mean that they were prone to
violence, and themselves died violently.

You would more commonly see *death by X* as opposed to *died by X*:

## maximal \| maximum, minimal \| minimum

***Maximum*** and ***minimum*** relate to absolute values&mdash;there is
nothing higher than the maximum and nothing lower than the minimum.
                                                                                                    
***Minimal***  means *very small* as opposed to *the lowest possible*; the same
distinction is true of ***maximum*** and ***maximal***:

> *I want to buy this at **minimal** cost.*

> *This action carries a **minimal** risk.*

In some areas of mathematics (e.g., in *maximal element*, *maximal matching*),
a *maximal value* (you can’t use *the* with this meaning) is essentially a
local maximum&mdash;it’s a maximum value in its neighborhood.

A *clique* is a set of people all of whom know each other. A clique is
***maximal*** if adding anyone else to the set destroys the clique property,
that is, there is no larger clique that contains it. A clique is ***maximum***
if there is no larger clique. There can be many maximum cliques. Every maximum
clique is maximal, but not vice-versa.

## dot \| full stop \| period \| point

The little dot at the end of a sentence is called **period** in American
English and **full stop** in British English:

> *You are not going out with Zack, **period**.* [AmEn]

> *You are not going out with Zack, **full stop**.* [BrEn]

**Dot** is used when pronouncing the character in URLs.
                                                                                                                                                                                              
**Point** refers to the dot glyph used in numbers to separate the fractional
part from the integer part. The numbers after the decimal point are pronounced
in isolation:

> 3.14 = *three **point** one four*

> 36.952 = *thirty six **point** nine five two*

> 0.25 = *zero **point** two five*

> .25 = ***point** two five*

## directive \| instruction

### IT

An ***instruction*** is directly translated to something the CPU can execute. A
***directive*** is something the assembler can interpret and use it while
assembling, it does not produce any machine code.

### General

A **directive** is mainly an order, usually issued by an authority. A directive
may establish policy, assign responsibilities, define objectives and delegate
authority. ***Instructions***, on the other hand, act as guidelines. They often
appear as a series of steps or stages one must complete one after the other.
Instructions are mainly associated with instruction or teaching.

## during \| while

**During** is a preposition followed by a noun or pronoun:

> *I learned some Russian **while** I was studying in Russia.*

**While** is a conjunction followed by a clause:

> *I met a nice French girl **during** my stay in Switzerland.*

### during + ing vs while + ing:

A participial phrase[^participial-phrase] in which the present
participle[^present-participle] *reading* modifies *I*:

> ***While reading** the book, I fell asleep.*

> ~~***During reading** the book*...~~

For the present participle, you should use **while**. For it to be a gerund, it
needs a determiner:

> ***During my reading** the book, I fell asleep.*

That’s a bit awkward, but grammatically correct.

[^participial-phrase]: participial phrase = причастный оборот

***Process*** infers more of an operation by a machine or something that a
computer does.

There’s often no difference intended. ***Process*** sometimes suggests that
there is a standard method already established to do something. So, if it’s a
new problem or situation, you can ***handle*** it, but not really process it.

## menace \| threat

**Threat**: potential to danger                                                                                                                                                                   

**Menace**: bothersome

Both menace and threat are used to describe someone or something that is
dangerous and will probably cause trouble:                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                              
> *I don’t see my new coworker as a **threat** to my position in the office.*

> *“Injustice anywhere is a **threat** to justice everywhere.”&mdash;Martin
  Luther King, Jr.*

> *If you drink and drive, you are a **menace** to public safety.*

> *I could hear the **menace** in Jenny’s voice.*

However, ***threat*** would not be the right word to describe an unruly little
boy. While ***menace*** is also used to mean *annoying*, ***threat*** implies
something more serious.

If you make a threat, it means you state that you are planning to cause
somebody harm:

Both involve the art of deception: it’s the methods that differ. ***Guise*** is
about trying on new attitudes and mannerisms, such as speaking and acting in
the guise of a native in a place where you are actually a tourist.
***Disguise*** involves hiding your real identity, disappearing in the new
role.

## schema \| schemata \| scheme

### General

***Schema*** is a more technical term than *scheme*. It refers to drawings or diagrams that provide a structured framework or outline of a plan. It is also a philosophical term referring to how categories are associated with emotion. A ***scheme*** is more generally an organized plan and, unlike *schema*, can also be used as a verb.

Exception: *color scheme*. If we all spoke more strictly, this would probably be ~~*color schema*~~, but in fact, *scheme* and *schema* are very close words, both derived from one Ancient Latin/Greek word, and so in casual usage can seem interchangeable. Since scientists no longer rely on ***schema*** as an important term of scientific practice, or debate, it has lost the institutional rigor it once enjoyed and is now slowly morphing together with ***scheme***.

***Schemata*** (=schemas) is a plural form of *schema*.

### IT

**Schema** or **scheme**:

- in general terms, any organization, coding, outline or plan of concepts;

- machine-processable specification which defines the structure and syntax of metadata specifications in a formal schema language.

**Encoding scheme**&mdash;a set of rules for encoding information that supports a specific community of users.

**Schema**&mdash;the structure of a database; encapsulates tables and columns, allows for normalization and regulation of the data being entered into the database.

## run in Windows \| run on Windows \| run under Windows

*run on windows*: 602,000 results on the web

*run under windows*: 278,000 results on the web

The Corpus of Contemporary American English has twelve records for *run on Windows* and eleven for *run under Windows*. The British National Corpus shows a decisive preference for the latter, with nine records, against one for the former.

Originally operating systems would be seen roughly like a set of rules, in which case you ***run under*** a set of rules. Nowadays an operating system is seen as a basis for building things upon, like a foundation, in which case you ***run on*** a foundation. Both are valid.

As generic word usage, you would say *on a platform*, not *in a platform*. Saying that the program ***runs in** Linux* calls up the idea of using Linux as a container or environment. This is not wrong, but it’s less common.

## ~~log in to~~ \| log into \| ~~login to~~ \| log on

It should go without saying that *into* is a single word. It’s a preposition that expresses movement towards something else:

> *I went in to drink* (not ~~*went into*~~ = I went into a place called “drink”)

***Login*** can be either a noun or adjective, therefore should not be followed by *to*.

When you ***log on*** to something, you are simply accessing digital material, without necessarily needing to provide credentials:

> ***Log on** to the news website of your choice and choose an article to discuss in class next week.*

A *login* usually requires credentials.

> *Both publishers and artists are **included in** the list.*

This is because *include* has a strong tendency to be used with *in*. Except after *include*, I recommend that you use ***on the list***.

In computing, **rebooting** is the process by which a running computer system is restarted, either intentionally or unintentionally.

> *as a whole, on the whole*, etc.

The expression *whole life* considers one’s life to be a single unit that has not been subdivided. An *entire life* means all the parts (years? experiences?) of a life. In this case either could be used.

## quotation \| quote

Originally ***quote*** is a verb and ***quotation*** is a noun.

**quote** (noun)&mdash;short for *quotation*

English scholars and puritans would still prefer to go by the word ***quotation*** rather than *quote*, but in the informal setting, ***quote*** is the preferred choice. With the prolific use of *quote* instead of *quotation* in many online and offline resources, you are safe to use the words interchangeably.

## effort at \| effort in \| effort of \| effort to

effort\[s\] ***to*** {infinitive} is a more common form.

***effort at*** focuses on energy/resources that are required for the effort.

***effort in*** emphasizes that something requires certain energy/resources for the success.

One can say *trapping effort*, or *effort ***of*** trapping*, but the meaning is different than with the preposition *in* or *at*. In a noun-noun construct the first noun (the noun adjunct) serves the role of an adjective.

## ratio between ... and \| ratio of ... to

Some believe that ***the between ... and*** construct is less formal, others mention that it is not uncommon (even in math).

> *The **ratio between** girls and boys in the drama club is about 4 **to** 1.*

> *BMI is the **ratio of** someone’s weight **to** their height.*

> *BMI is the **ratio between** someone’s weight **and** their height.*

## beside \| besides

***Beside*** (next to, aside of) tells us the location of something and physically places two nouns side by side:

> *The barn **beside** the farmer’s house was falling down.*

> *Will you sit **beside** me at dinner?*

***Beside the point*** is a common idiom that means “unimportant” or “not relevant to the matter at hand”.

***Besides***&mdash;in addition, in addition to, moreover, as well:

> *I dislike fishing; **besides** (= moreover, what’s more), I don’t even own a boat.*

> *Do you have any M&Ms **besides** (= in addition to) the green ones?*

## at each step \| in each step \| on each step

***In each step***&mdash;something is done or happens as part of the process:

> *Assembling the furniture consists of seven steps. **In each step** a new piece is added to the assembly.*

***At each step***&mdash;something is done additionally to the process:

> *Creating a report takes three steps. **At each step** the author is required to check with a reviewer that it has been done correctly.*

***On*** turns the emphasis away from the person taking action, to emphasis the step as more crucial. *Step* could be a physical step (on a staircase or ladder) or a specific procedure one must do or follow:

> *While climbing the ladder to pick cherries, "Warning: Serious Injury May Occur if extended beyond 5 Meters" was written **on every step**.*

> *In building any model airplane with high voltage, safety equipment must be worn on every step, when performing steps 8 thru 14 below* [Whenever steps 8 thru 14 are performed, no matter which step it is between 8 and 14, safety equipment is necessary to prevent serious injury.)

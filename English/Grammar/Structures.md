## for + gerund | to + infinitive

Some verbs can be used with a gerund (***verb-ing***) or an infinitive (***to \+ verb***), but the meaning changes. For example:

- ***Like***: can be used with both gerunds and infinitives without much change in meaning, however:

  - ***like + gerund***&mdash;you enjoy something:

    > *I **like going** on holiday.*

  - ***like + to + infinitive***&mdash;you want to say that you think it’s a good idea:

    > *I **like to go** to the dentist every 6 months.*

- ***Stop***:

  > *I **stopped working**.* (I was working, then I stopped)

  > *I **stopped to** answer the phone.* (This is the reason I stopped)

- ***Remember***:

  > *I’m sure I bought the milk&mdash;I **remember buying** it!* (I did it, and now I remember it&mdash;buy first, remember after!)

  > *Don’t worry&mdash;I **remembered to** buy the milk.* (I thought of it, then I did it&mdash;remember first, buy after!)

- ***Forget***:

  > *I’ll never **forget buying** my first car* (I did it, and I won’t forget it&mdash;buy first, (not) forget after)

  > *I **forgot to** buy the milk.* (I didn’t do it because I forgot&mdash;forget first, buy after)

- ***Try***:

  > *I couldn’t sleep, so I **tried drinking** warm milk.* (This was one possible way to achieve what I wanted)

- ***Need***:

  > *He **needs to** clean the toilet.* (Active, he should do it)

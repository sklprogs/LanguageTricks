## stop + -ing \| stop to + infinitive

We use the ***-ing*** form after stop to indicate that an action or event is no longer continuing:

> *It’s **stopped raining**. Let’s go for a walk.*

We use the ***to-infinitive*** after stop to indicate that someone stops doing something in order to do something else:

> *On the way to Edinburgh, we **stopped to** look at an old castle.* \[We were travelling, then we stopped our journey in order to look at the castle.\]

## for + gerund | to + infinitive

Some verbs can be used with a gerund (***verb-ing***) or an infinitive (***to \+ verb***), but the meaning changes. For example:

- ***Like***: can be used with both gerunds and infinitives without much change in meaning, however:

  - ***like + gerund***&mdash;you enjoy something:

    > *I **like going** on holiday.*

  - ***like + to + infinitive***&mdash;you want to say that you think it’s a good idea:

    > *I **like to go** to the dentist every 6 months.*

- ***Stop***:

  > *I **stopped working**.* (I was working, then I stopped)

  > *I **stopped to** answer the phone.* (This is the reason I stopped)

- ***Remember***:

  > *I’m sure I bought the milk&mdash;I **remember buying** it!* (I did it, and now I remember it&mdash;buy first, remember after!)

  > *Don’t worry&mdash;I **remembered to** buy the milk.* (I thought of it, then I did it&mdash;remember first, buy after!)

- ***Forget***:

  > *I’ll never **forget buying** my first car* (I did it, and I won’t forget it&mdash;buy first, (not) forget after)

  > *I **forgot to** buy the milk.* (I didn’t do it because I forgot&mdash;forget first, buy after)

- ***Try***:

  > *I couldn’t sleep, so I **tried drinking** warm milk.* (This was one possible way to achieve what I wanted)

  > *I **tried to** sleep, but the music was too loud.* (This is what I wanted to achieve, but it was difficult, and maybe I didn’t succeed)

- ***Need***:

  > *He **needs to** clean the toilet.* (Active, he should do it)

  > *The toilet **needs cleaning**.* (Passive, someone should do it&mdash;it should be done)

- ***Go on***:

  > *I **went on** working all night.* (I continued this)

  > *I was a teacher, but I **went on** to work as a journalist.* (This is what I did next)

- ***Mean***:

## data

When ***data*** is a count noun (items that can be counted), the plural makes sense.

> *The **data** used were out of date.*

In that type of sentence, you could replace ***data*** with another count noun such as *facts*.

However, when ***data*** is treated as a non-count noun (items cannot be counted), the singular makes sense.

> *The **data** used was out of date.*

With that type of sentence, you could replace ***data*** with a word such as *information*.

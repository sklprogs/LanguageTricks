It is stated clearly in the dictionary and various grammar books that the word ***also*** (which means *in addition*&mdash;a logical connector) is placed *after* the auxiliary verbs. It sounds more formal when used unlike ***also can*** or *also could* which sounded more informal and colloquial (ordinary conversation, informal).

## Words and Phrases

### load \| the load

***Load*** can be countable or uncountable. If you are talking about a specific load, than it is countable:

> ***The load** on this circuit is 200 watts.*

If you are talking about the idea of (for example), electrical power requirements, then it is uncountable:

> *Our teacher explained the concept of **load** and how it affects electrical circuits.*

### literature \| the literature

An article is not needed for a general use. When ***literature*** refers to a specific collection of books, papers, etc., is related to a given subject, we use ***the***.

### experience \| an experience \| experiences

*Countable*: an event or incident. It is an event that you were a part of and the event made an impression on you (it’s something you will remember). These type of experiences are countable, just like events.

> *Climbing Mount Everest was an **experience** that I’ll never forget.*

> *I have had some bad **experiences** with taxi drivers.*

*Uncountable*: familiarity. You have used computers for many years, so you are familiar with them, you have knowledge of them, and you have skill using them:

## Abbreviations

### Acronyms

***Acronyms*** (which are read as words) tend not to require preceding articles at all except when they are used adjectivally[^adjectivally]:

> *The patient was diagnosed with AIDS.*

> *UNESCO designates World Heritage Sites.*

> *Finland is not a member of NATO.*

> ***The** AIDS <ins>patient</ins>*

> *The Giza pyramids are **a** UNESCO <ins>World Heritage Site</ins>.*

> ***The** UNICEF <ins>campaign</ins> raised awareness.*

### Initialisms

***Initialisms*** (which are pronounced as individual letters) tend to use a preceding article (whether definite or indefinite):

> ***a** CD*

> ***an** NGO*

> ***the** EU*

> *He has a new job at **the** BBC.*

> ***The** UN was voting later that day.*

> ***An** FBI agent has infiltrated the group.*

> ***The** DVD player is broken.*

However, when you use an initialism as a noun that names a condition or illness, a substance, or a method of doing something, you do not usually need an article:

> *DDT[^ddt] has been banned for many years.*

> *Too much typing has given me RSI[^rsi].*

> *The course teaches you how to use CPR[^cpr].*

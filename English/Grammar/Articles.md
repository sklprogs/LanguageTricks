## Words and Phrases

### such \| such a

| Form | Type of nouns | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| such a(n) | countable, singular | ***such an** apple* |
| such | countable, plural | ***such** apples* |
| such | uncountable | ***Such** bravery is to be commended.* |

Same nouns can be countable or uncountable, singular or plural in different contexts:

> ***Such** honor is to be revered.*

> ***Such an** honor is to be bestowed.*

> ***Such** honors are to be bestowed.*

***Such a*** is required before singular countable nouns even if no emphasis is intended:

> *Throughout this article, we refer to **such a** block or range of nodes with the term “context node”.*

***

### progress \| ~~a progress~~ \| the progress

When we refer to the ways in which society in general goes forward and improves itself, we use progress without ***the***:

> ***Progress** will only happen when people begin to understand that every individual has a responsibility to play their part.*

> *~~The progress will only~~ ...*

***Progress*** is a mass noun and cannot be regarded as a count noun, except in an archaic form:

> Religious processions and royal **progresses** have been an important practice in the Indian subcontinent.

***

### part of \| a part of

Generally, you can use either.

If you say *Money is **part** of the American Dream*, you mean that both ideas are strongly linked together.

If you said *Money is **a part** of the American Dream*, it would mean that money is only a part of the American Dream. You would focus on just one part as opposed to the rest. The second solution is grammatically correct but seems awkward as it would be difficult to find a context in which it fits.

### part \| a part

Both ***part*** and ***a part*** can be used to refer to a discrete countable thing:

> *We teach several skills. Dancing is **part** of what we teach.*

> *We teach several skills. Dancing is **a part** of what we teach.*

Both ***part*** and ***a part*** can be used to refer to a more general portion of a thing that is not countable:

> ***Part** of the food* \[or money, or care\] *will be devoted to the poor.*

> ***A part** of the food* \[or money, or care\] *will be devoted to the poor.*

The portion to be devoted is not defined in these sentences as comprising a specific discrete section or item, but either construction is clear and appropriate. The addition of the article a may give a slight connotation that the portion may already be determined, but not necessarily.

### load \| the load

***Load*** can be countable or uncountable. If you are talking about a specific load, than it is countable:

> ***The load** on this circuit is 200 watts.*

If you are talking about the idea of (for example), electrical power requirements, then it is uncountable:

### experience \| an experience \| experiences

*Countable*: an event or incident. It is an event that you were a part of and the event made an impression on you (it’s something you will remember). These type of experiences are countable, just like events.

> *I have had some bad **experiences** with taxi drivers.*

*Uncountable*: familiarity. You have used computers for many years, so you are familiar with them, you have knowledge of them, and you have skill using them:

## Abbreviations

### Acronyms

***Acronyms*** (which are read as words) tend not to require preceding articles at all except when they are used adjectivally[^adjectivally]:

> *The patient was diagnosed with AIDS.*

> *UNESCO designates World Heritage Sites.*

> *Finland is not a member of NATO.*

> ***The** AIDS <ins>patient</ins>*

> *The Giza pyramids are **a** UNESCO <ins>World Heritage Site</ins>.*

> ***The** UNICEF <ins>campaign</ins> raised awareness.*

### Initialisms

***Initialisms*** (which are pronounced as individual letters) tend to use a preceding article (whether definite or indefinite):

> ***a** CD*

> ***an** NGO*

> ***the** EU*

> *He has a new job at **the** BBC.*

> ***The** UN was voting later that day.*

> ***An** FBI agent has infiltrated the group.*

> ***The** DVD player is broken.*

However, when you use an initialism as a noun that names a condition or illness, a substance, or a method of doing something, you do not usually need an article:

> *DDT[^ddt] has been banned for many years.*

> *Too much typing has given me RSI[^rsi].*

> *The course teaches you how to use CPR[^cpr].*

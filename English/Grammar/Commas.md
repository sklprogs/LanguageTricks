## Before a subordinate conjunction

A subordinate clause[^subordinate_clause] will not form a complete sentence. It will instead make a reader want additional information to finish the thought. The examples of subordinate conjunctions[^subordinate_conjunction] are *after, although, as, because, before, even if, even, though, if, in order that, once, since, so that, than, that, though, unless*, etc.

The rule is to use a comma after the subordinate clause rather than before the subordinate conjunction:

> *Jonathon spent his class time reading comic books since his average was a 45 one week before final exams.*

> *Since Jonathon’s class average was a 45 one week before final exams, he spent his class time reading comic books.*

[^subordinate_clause]: Subordinate clause \= придаточное (зависимое) предложение.

[^subordinate_conjunction]: Subordinate conjunction \= подчинительный союз.

## Words and Phrases

### If necessary, if required, when needed, where needed, etc.

At the start of a sentence, use a comma after *if necessary, if needed, when required, where needed*, etc.:

> ***If necessary**, I can stay up late to complete the work.*

Normally, you don’t need a comma in mid-sentence or at the end of the sentence:

> *I will help you **if needed**.*

However, use commas to set off these expressions if they interrupt the sentence flow or provide an explanatory note:

> *Use disposable gloves, **when required**, before handling food.*

> *The British army needs women and men who are willing to fight for their country, **if necessary**.*

***

### Furthermore, however, moreover, therefore

1. At the beginning of a sentence: put a comma after these words (some modern writers are now dropping the comma).

   > ***Therefore**, we will proceed with the order.*

   > ***However**, we still have hope.*

   1.1. A traditional rule stated that ***however*** meaning *nevertheless* should not be used at the beginning of a sentence. Most style guides consider this rule old-fashioned.

2. Use a semicolon and comma to introduce a new independent clause (a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.)

   > *She always meets her deadlines; **furthermore**, her work is good.*

   > *We plan to stay for another year; **however**, Peter is leaving now.*

   2.1. Some writers are now treating *however, therefore, moreover* and *furthermore* as conjunctions and just using a comma:
   
     > *We plan to stay for another year, **however** Peter is leaving now.*

   2.2. You can also use ***however*** as a conjunction to mean *by whatever means*:
   
     > *I don’t care **however** you do it, just get it done.*

3. As intensifiers or for emphasis:

   > *You can, **therefore**, do whatever you like.*

   > *The vegetables, **furthermore**, are good for you.*

### But

| Comma position | Put in a comma | Case explanation | Example |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Before | \+ | *But* connects two independent clauses[^independent_clause]. | *The rules aren’t written down anywhere, **but** the important rules rarely are.* |
|        |    |                                                              | *I have a gym membership, **but** I rarely use it.* |
|        |    |                                                              | *I want to go to Italy this year, **but** my kinds want to go to Greece.* |
|        | \- | *But* connects an independent clause with a dependent clause. | *You had a birthday party **but** didn’t tell me about it?* |
|        |    |                                                               | *You left me with nothing **but** a broken promise.* |
| After  | \+ | You’re interrupting the sentence flow with another word or clause immediately after *but*, to create emphasis. | *I enjoyed the book, **but**, to be honest, I didn’t completely understand it.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | ***But**, as you know, the dodo bird went extinct long ago.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | *I tried to go to the grocery store, **but**, as it turns out, it closed early.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | ***But**, my dear, you didn’t tell me the whole story.* |

[^independent_clause]: An independent clause is a string of words that can stand on its own as a complete sentence, with a subject and an object.

### Otherwise

#### Conjunction (connector of clauses)

> *He couldn’t see her; **otherwise**, he would have to tell her the truth.* (~~, otherwise,~~: two independent clauses are connected. Always place a comma after *otherwise* here.[^otherwise])

[^otherwise]: Some sources allow *, otherwise, * or *Otherwise∅*

> He couldn’t see her. Otherwise, he would have to tell her the truth.

We can use <ins>;</ins> or <ins>.</ins> interchangeably. Many people use <ins>;</ins> when they want the sentence to continue a little longer, while <ins>.</ins> are useful for breaking up sentences or long bodies of text.

#### Part of a parenthetical element[^parenthetical]

[^parenthetical]: Parenthetical element = поясняющая конструкция

> *My job, **otherwise** known as hell on earth, is causing me to have a lot of issues.*

> *You shouldn’t have said that to Mr. Hampshire, **otherwise** known as Paul.*

#### Adjective

Many people avoid using this old-fashioned structure today because it’s not too particular with its meaning.

> *This **otherwise** delicious piece of fruit isn’t something I’ve ever thought of trying myself.*

> *An **otherwise** pleasure had become a grinding chore.*

> *I couldn’t have said it better **otherwise**.*

> *There will be no surprises – pleasant or **otherwise**.*

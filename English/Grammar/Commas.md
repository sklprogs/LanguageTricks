## Words and Phrases

### Which

| Role | Comma Before | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduces a nonrestrictive phrase | \+ | *Everyone loved Robin’s video, **which** she had filmed in her garage.* |
| | | *Jeff’s new car, **which** is less than a month old, already started leaking oil.* |
| Part of a prepositional phrase (*as of which*, *in which* or *on which*) | \- | *The envelope <ins>in</ins> **which** the letter arrived had no return address.* |
| | | *We heard three speeches, the longest of **which** went for an hour.* |
| | | *The platform <ins>on</ins> **which** we built our program is very stable.* |
| Introduces an indirect question | \- | *I asked Sam **which** bus I should take.* |

If a phrase is restrictive instead of nonrestrictive, it means that you can’t take it out of the sentence without changing the meaning. Restrictive phrases are usually introduced by ***that*** instead of *which*, especially in AmE:

> *Cars **that** Jeff buys always seem to break down.*

### Possibly

#### *Possibly* at the beginning of a sentence

> *\- Will he come?*
> *\- **Possibly** not.*

> *\- Do you think this skirt might be too small for her?*
> *\- **Possibly**, she has put on weight.*

> ***Possibly**, the use of subject-based ratings leads to lower response rates than the use of investigator’s ratings.*

#### *Possibly* in the middle of a sentence

> *There are four, **possibly** five people who have been injured in the explosion.*

> *He can’t **possibly** have drunk all that on his own!*

> *The need for flexibility will be particularly important as economic conditions change, and **possibly** economic paradigms.*

> *After that period, new parasitoids would emerge and **possibly** reduce further the spread of the virus.*

> *However, they have not found favour with many workers, **possibly** due to complexity and expense.*

#### *Possibly* at the end of a sentence

> *\- Have another chocolate.*
> *\- No, really, I <ins>couldn’t</ins> possibly.* \[politely refusing offers\]

***

### Perhaps

#### *Perhaps* at the beginning of a sentence

Although *perhaps* can be an introductory word, it generally does not require a comma:

> ***Perhaps** Emma is not feeling well today.* \[*Perhaps* refers to not knowing how Emma is feeling.\]

The comma indicates that there is a slight pause for some reason:

> *\- Will Emma be joining us on the tour?*

> *\- **Perhaps**, she is not feeling well today.* \[*Perhaps* refers to not knowing whether Emma will be joining them.\]

When it is a response to a yes\/no question, separating *perhaps* with a comma means that the speaker knows that Emma is definitely not feeling well today.

In more formal writing, in order to avoid a comma splice or sentence fragment, that reply should really be two separate sentences: 

> ***Perhaps** she won’t. She is not feeling well today.*

#### *Perhaps* in the middle of a sentence

Usually, you would not use a comma after *perhaps* in the middle of a sentence:

> *They are **perhaps** a little too eager to convince us that they won’t damage the car.*

As is the case with *perhaps* at the beginning of a sentence, you would only use a comma around *perhaps* in the middle of a sentence if you needed to emphasize it for some reason:

> *Many people have suggested that, **perhaps**, you are lying to us.*

In this sentence, setting *perhaps* apart with the commas makes it sound a little more sinister and serious.

#### *Perhaps* at the end of a nonessential clause

If *perhaps* comes at the end of a nonessential element in a sentence, it should be followed by a comma.

A nonessential element is a part of the sentence that could be removed without changing its meaning:

> *She was talking to some people, <ins>her neighbors</ins> **perhaps**, when we drove up.*

***

### In that case,
### In this case,

You should place a comma after both phrases. They work as their own separate clause to introduce a new idea, meaning they need a comma to help break up the flow of the sentence.

*See also [In that case \| In this case](../Vocabulary.md#in-that-case--in-this-case) \[Vocabulary\]*

***

### Except

If the word after *except* is a noun or pronoun or if it’s another preposition, particularly *for*, then *except* is a preposition.

If *except* is acting as a preposition in a parenthetical phrase <ins>in the middle</ins> of a sentence, you should use commas. But if it’s a prepositional phrase[^prepositional_phrase] <ins>at the end</ins> of a sentence, no comma is necessary.


| Role | Comma Before | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Conjunction | \+ | *I wanted to go shopping, **except** I was broke until payday.* |
| | | *The teacher always lets students have their phones out, **except** <ins>when</ins> the principal is in the room.* |
| | | *I go for a run every day, **except** Sundays and holidays, to work out and relieve stress.* |
| | | *She invited everyone in the class, **except** Joan and me, to her birthday party.* |
| Preposition | \- | *She tried everything from the buffet **except** the fish.* |
| | | *She had fond memories of all her visits to the lake **except** <ins>for</ins> the time she was bitten by leeches.* |
| | | *The library opens at 10 a.m. every day **except** Thursdays.*

[^parenthetical_element]: Parenthetical element \= поясняющая конструкция.

[^prepositional_phrase]: Prepositional phrase \= предложный оборот.

### If necessary, if required, when needed, where needed, etc.

At the start of a sentence, use a comma after *if necessary, if needed, when required, where needed*, etc.:

> ***If necessary**, I can stay up late to complete the work.*

Normally, you don’t need a comma in mid-sentence or at the end of the sentence:

> *I will help you **if needed**.*

However, use commas to set off these expressions if they interrupt the sentence flow or provide an explanatory note:

> *Use disposable gloves, **when required**, before handling food.*

> *The British army needs women and men who are willing to fight for their country, **if necessary**.*

***

### Furthermore, however, moreover, therefore

1. At the beginning of a sentence: put a comma after these words (some modern writers are now dropping the comma).

   > ***Therefore**, we will proceed with the order.*

   > ***However**, we still have hope.*

   1.1. A traditional rule stated that ***however*** meaning *nevertheless* should not be used at the beginning of a sentence. Most style guides consider this rule old-fashioned.

2. Use a semicolon and comma to introduce a new independent clause (a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought.)

   > *She always meets her deadlines; **furthermore**, her work is good.*

   > *We plan to stay for another year; **however**, Peter is leaving now.*

   2.1. Some writers are now treating *however, therefore, moreover* and *furthermore* as conjunctions and just using a comma:
   
     > *We plan to stay for another year, **however** Peter is leaving now.*

   2.2. You can also use ***however*** as a conjunction to mean *by whatever means*:
   
     > *I don’t care **however** you do it, just get it done.*

3. As intensifiers or for emphasis:

   > *You can, **therefore**, do whatever you like.*

   > *The vegetables, **furthermore**, are good for you.*

### But

| Comma position | Put in a comma | Case explanation | Example |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Before | \+ | *But* connects two independent clauses[^independent_clause]. | *The rules aren’t written down anywhere, **but** the important rules rarely are.* |
|        |    |                                                              | *I have a gym membership, **but** I rarely use it.* |
|        |    |                                                              | *I want to go to Italy this year, **but** my kinds want to go to Greece.* |
|        | \- | *But* connects an independent clause with a dependent clause. | *You had a birthday party **but** didn’t tell me about it?* |
|        |    |                                                               | *You left me with nothing **but** a broken promise.* |
| After  | \+ | You’re interrupting the sentence flow with another word or clause immediately after *but*, to create emphasis. | *I enjoyed the book, **but**, to be honest, I didn’t completely understand it.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | ***But**, as you know, the dodo bird went extinct long ago.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | *I tried to go to the grocery store, **but**, as it turns out, it closed early.* |
|        |    |                                                                                                                | ***But**, my dear, you didn’t tell me the whole story.* |

[^independent_clause]: An independent clause is a string of words that can stand on its own as a complete sentence, with a subject and an object.

***

### Otherwise

#### Conjunction (connector of clauses)

> *He couldn’t see her; **otherwise**, he would have to tell her the truth.* (~~, otherwise,~~: two independent clauses are connected. Always place a comma after *otherwise* here.[^otherwise])

[^otherwise]: Some sources allow *, otherwise, * or *Otherwise∅*

> He couldn’t see her. Otherwise, he would have to tell her the truth.

We can use <ins>;</ins> or <ins>.</ins> interchangeably. Many people use <ins>;</ins> when they want the sentence to continue a little longer, while <ins>.</ins> are useful for breaking up sentences or long bodies of text.

#### Part of a parenthetical element[^parenthetical]

[^parenthetical]: Parenthetical element = поясняющая конструкция

> *My job, **otherwise** known as hell on earth, is causing me to have a lot of issues.*

> *You shouldn’t have said that to Mr. Hampshire, **otherwise** known as Paul.*

#### Adjective

Many people avoid using this old-fashioned structure today because it’s not too particular with its meaning.

> *This **otherwise** delicious piece of fruit isn’t something I’ve ever thought of trying myself.*

> *An **otherwise** pleasure had become a grinding chore.*

> *I couldn’t have said it better **otherwise**.*

> *There will be no surprises – pleasant or **otherwise**.*

### Such as

| Type of a phrase | Comma before *such as* | Example | Explanation |
|------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Restrictive | \- | *Bands **such as** The Who and Deep Purple are known for playing loud.* | *such as* cannot be omitted |
| Non-restrictive | \+ | *I’m a big fan of frozen desserts, **such as** popsicles and ice cream.* | *such as* can be omitted: \= *I’m a big fan of frozen desserts.* |

## Before a subordinate conjunction

A subordinate clause[^subordinate_clause] will not form a complete sentence. It will instead make a reader want additional information to finish the thought. The examples of subordinate conjunctions[^subordinate_conjunction] are *after, although, as, because, before, even if, even, though, if, in order that, once, since, so that, than, that, though, unless*, etc.

The rule is to use a comma after the subordinate clause rather than before the subordinate conjunction:

> *Jonathon spent his class time reading comic books since his average was a 45 one week before final exams.*

> *Since Jonathon’s class average was a 45 one week before final exams, he spent his class time reading comic books.*

[^subordinate_clause]: Subordinate clause \= придаточное (зависимое) предложение.

[^subordinate_conjunction]: Subordinate conjunction \= подчинительный союз.

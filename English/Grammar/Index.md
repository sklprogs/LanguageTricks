## Formatting Punctuation Marks

### Italicizing Comma After an Italic Word

If the commas are not logically part of the italicized material, they should not be italicized.

> We rented the movie *Planes, Trains and Automobiles*. \[The comma is part of the title\]

### Punctuation Mark and a Word Before

The formatting of the punctuation mark should match the formatting of the word before, but there can be exceptions:

> The difference is statistically significant (*p* < .05).

### Colon at the End of a Heading

Do not underline the colon at the end of a heading.

## Capitalization

### Tables \[Capitalization\]

\[Microsoft Style Guide\]

Use sentence-style capitalization for:
- the table title;
- each column header;
- the text in cells unless there’s a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be lowercase).

| Tables are sometimes useful for	| Example |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| Data or values | Text formats and their associated HTML codes |
| Simple instructions | User interface actions and their associated keyboard shortcuts |
| Categories of things with examples | SKUs[^SKU] and the products they include |
| Collections of things with two or more attributes | Event dates with times and locations |

[^SKU]: Stock Keeping Unit = артикул (код товара)

### Table of Contents \[Capitalization\]

If you use a certain capitalization in the title of a chapter, then use the same capitalization whenever you mention that title elsewhere, including within the Table of Contents.

### To \[Capitalization\]

Capitalize ***to*** if:
- it is the first word of the title:
  > ***To** Infinity and Beyond*
- it is used as an adverb (*to and fro*, *come to*, *pull to*):
  > *Walking **To** <ins>and Fro</ins>*
  
  > *<ins>Pull</ins> the Door **To** and Lock It*

- it is the last word of the title \[depends on a style guide\]:
  > *Music That You Can Dance **To***

Do not capitalize ***to*** in all other cases:
- *Back *to* the 50s* \[preposition, all style guides\]
- *You Don’t Have **to** Tell Me* \[infinitive, depends on a style guide\]

## Singular or plural

### None \[Singular or plural\]

| Role | Example | Explanation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Plural noun | ***None** of the movies **are** worth watching.* | *movies* is plural |
| Singular noun | ***None** of your advice **is** helpful.* | *advice* is singular |
| Plural pronoun | ***None** of my friends **are** going to the fair.* | *none* could be substituted with *not any* |
| Singular pronoun | *She ate it all, and now **none is** left.* | *none* could be substituted with *nothing* |
| Adverb | *We’ll take it while he’s not looking, and he’ll **be none** the wiser.* | *none* is modifying the verb *be* and effectively means *not at all* |

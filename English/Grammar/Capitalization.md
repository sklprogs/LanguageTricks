## Tables

\[Microsoft Style Guide\]

Use sentence-style capitalization for:
- the table title;
- each column header;
- the text in cells unless there’s a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be lowercase).

| Tables are sometimes useful for | Example |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| Data or values | Text formats and their associated HTML codes |
| Simple instructions | User interface actions and their associated keyboard shortcuts |
| Categories of things with examples | SKUs[^SKU] and the products they include |
| Collections of things with two or more attributes | Event dates with times and locations |

[^SKU]: Stock Keeping Unit = артикул (код товара)

## Table of Contents

If you use a certain capitalization in the title of a chapter, then use the same capitalization whenever you mention that title elsewhere, including within the Table of Contents.

## To

Capitalize ***to*** if:
- it is the first word of the title:
  > ***To** Infinity and Beyond*
- it is used as an adverb (*to and fro*, *come to*, *pull to*):
  > *Walking **To** <ins>and Fro</ins>*
  
  > *<ins>Pull</ins> the Door **To** and Lock It*

- it is the last word of the title \[depends on a style guide\]:
  > *Music That You Can Dance **To***

Do not capitalize ***to*** in all other cases:
- *Back *to* the 50s* \[preposition, all style guides\]
- *You Don’t Have **to** Tell Me* \[infinitive, depends on a style guide\]

***

## outside \| outside of

***Outside of***:

- not recommended for formal writing;
- tends to be more commonly used in the US than in Britain;
- often used as a colloquial way of saying *except for*, *other than*, *apart from*:

> ***Outside of** what I just mentioned, I can’t think of any reason not to.*

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9700/outside-or-outside-of)

***

## opposite \| opposite to

- As a noun, ***opposite*** may stand alone or be followed by the preposition *of*:

  > *Madeleine believes just the **opposite**!*

  > *What is the **opposite** of up?*

- As an adjective, ***opposite*** may stand alone or be followed by the preposition to *or* occasionally *from*:

  > *The cars were travelling in **opposite** directions when the accident occurred.*

  > *Hyacinth’s opinions are often **opposite** to Pierre’s.*

  > *Keith’s cottage is on the same lake but on the **opposite** side from (or to) ours.*

- ***Opposite*** may also function as a preposition. The preposition ***opposite*** should not be followed by *of* or *to*:

  > *Jean-Luc lives in the house **opposite** ours.*

  > *Two dozen condos will be built **opposite** the theatre* (not ~~*opposite of the theatre*~~ or ~~*opposite to the theatre*~~).

***

## on \| onto

We use **onto** to:

- Talk about direction or movement to a position on a surface, usually with a verb that expresses movement:

  > *The cat climbed **onto** the roof.*

  > *She emptied the suitcase full of clothes **onto** the floor.*

- Describe movement towards an end position along a road or river:

  > *The path leads **onto** the main road.*

We use ***on*** or ***onto*** with very little difference in meaning to refer to attachment or movement of something to something else. ***Onto*** gives a stronger feeling of movement:

> *There's a battery pack with the camera that you can clip **onto** a belt.*

> *You can save the data **onto** your hard disk.*

> *Have you put the pictures **on** your memory stick?*

[*Source*](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/ru/грамматика/британская-грамматика/on-onto)

***

## notify about \| notify of \| ~~notify on~~

***Notify about*** = ***notify of*** (although *some* native speakers think that *of* sounds better):

> *Please **notify <ins>us</ins> of** any change of address* \[at least *someone* is required\]

| Pattern                      | Example                                                                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| notify somebody              | *Competition winners will be **notified** by post.*                              |
|                              | *You must **notify** us in writing if you wish to cancel your subscription.*     |
| notify somebody of something | *The police must be **notified of** the date of the demonstration.*              |
| notify something to somebody | *The date of the demonstration must be **notified** to the police.*              |
| notify somebody that         | *Members have been **notified that** there will be a small increase in the fee.* |

***Notify on*** has another meaning:

> *After a few minutes I get a **notification on** my iPhone, you can continue the journey!*

> *But I got a push **notification on** my Redbox app.*

> *Does the Member State submit a non confidential version of the **notification on** a voluntary basis?*

> *Slovenia withdrew its rescue aid **notification on** 1 August 2011.*

## mount at \| mount in \| mount on \| ~~mount to~~

Google Books Ngram Viewer [suggests](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=mounted+on+the+mount+point%2Cmounted+to+the+mount+point%2Cmounted+in+the+mount+point%2Cmounted+at+the+mount+point&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3) *mounted **on** the mount point* only.

Levin (English Verb Classes and Alternations) places *mount* under “Verbs of Putting”, and specifically says that the preposition ***to*** is wrong for such verbs. She lists some “Verbs of Combining and Attaching” which take the preposition *to* (*add*, *connect*, *join*, *link*), but does not include *mount* among them.

Other uses:

> *In the same year the entartete Kunst exhibition was **mounted in** Munich.*

> *The Party bitterly opposed the conspiracy theory that Evatt **mounted at** the Petrov Royal Commission.*

> *Residents suggest the deployment of an army unit to curb constant attacks **mounted by** the Somali Bandits in the area.*

> *These towers were manned day and night and were **mounted with**[^mount_with] a machine gun, rifle and searchlight.*

[^mount_with]: mount with = оборудовать, оснащать

> *Demands are **mounting for** a high-powered investigation with Liberal shadow minister Senator David Johnston today warning sex abuse claims were harming the reputation of the Catholic Church.*

***

## miss from \| miss in

**miss in**&mdash;something or somebody is lost within something. You suppose that their existence is true, but their temporal or spatial position is missing:

> ***Missing in** action*

> *What’s **missing in** your apartment?*

**Miss from**&mdash;something is lost entirely from its source, and whether or not it was there to begin with is irrelevant.

> *Copy of check is **missing from** the file*

~~Missing in the file~~ doesn’t make sense because it’s *not* in the file. The only use I can think of for ***missing in*** is when something (or someone) goes missing:

> *John went **missing in** Paris.*

> *I **missed** that new car **in** the first version of this computer game so much.* \[You obtained the first version of the game after you had already played version two. You regret going back to an older version.\]

> *I **missed** that new car **from** the first version of this computer game so much.* \[The car was in the first version but was absent from the second version.\]

You can’t really miss something until you have it. You don’t say to a girl you just met, *I’ve missed you all my life.* After you know her, and she goes away, then you can miss her:

> *I **missed** you while you were on vacation.*

***

## method for \| method of

**Method of** is how you do it. *A **method of** teaching* = a way to teach

*A **method for** teaching* = a system designed for teaching

*Sources: [1](https://hinative.com/questions/14244463),

***

## made from \| made of

**Made of** is used when the material the subject consists of doesn’t change during the process of making the subject.

> *Chairs are **made of** wood.*

Here, wood is still wood. It doesn’t transform into something else.

On the other hand, **made from** is used when the material changed its nature.

> *Paper is **made from** wood.*

Now, wood disappeared&mdash;it was transformed into paper.

Some more examples:

> *The house is **made of** bricks.* \[They are still bricks.\]

> *Wine is **made from** grapes.* \[Grapes turn into wine.\]

> *I have a table and it’s **made from** bamboo.*

The carpenter took stocks of bamboo, cut them, halved them, and made them into a table. The carpenter **modified** the bamboo’s **structural integrity**, so my table is **made from** bamboo.

> *I have a vase and it’s made of bamboo.*

The carpenter took a stock of bamboo and carved a vase out of it. The carpenter **didn’t modify** the bamboo’s **structural integrity**, so my vase is **made of** bamboo.

***

## ~~log in to~~ \| log into \| ~~login to~~ \| log on

It should go without saying that *into* is a single word. It’s a preposition that expresses movement towards something else:

> *I went into the building* (not ~~*went in to*~~ = I went in (somewhere) to do an activity called “the building”)

> *I went in to drink* (not ~~*went into*~~ = I went into a place called “drink”)

***Login*** can be either a noun or adjective, therefore should not be followed by *to*.

When you ***log on*** to something, you are simply accessing digital material, without necessarily needing to provide credentials:

> ***Log on** to the news website of your choice and choose an article to discuss in class next week.*

A *login* usually requires credentials.

***

## knowledge about \| knowledge of \| ~~knowledge on~~

**Knowledge about** implies knowing external details, without having experienced any of these:

> ***Knowledge about** writers.*

> ***Knowledge about** India, bicycles, heart disease.*

**Knowledge of** implies a more intimate knowledge from the inside out:

> *I would want to increase my **knowledge of** writers.*

Know science, know music:

> *Have **knowledge of** science /music* (not ~~*about*~~ them).

~~**Knowledge on**~~ is virtually never used.

***

## interfere in \| interfere with

In the case of someone else's life, you can either ***interfere in*** or **with**. The former is critical of the fact that you meddled at all. The latter is critical of the results of your meddling.

To **interfere with** means to disrupt:

> *Wave patterns can **interfere with** each other* \[they are mutually disruptive\]

Whilst it’s true that ***interfering in*** someone else’s affairs may be disruptive, it needn’t be. But if you ***interfere with*** their affairs, you’re definitely having a bad influence. There’s also the idiomatic usage of a paedophile ***interfering with*** a victim, which normally refers specifically to touching a child’s genitals.

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/38033/interfere-in-vs-interfere-with)

***

## integrate \| integrate in \| integrate into \| ~~integrate to~~ \| integrate with

**Integrate in**&mdash;combine many things into a whole:

> *We have **integrated in** companies many times.*

> *The **integration in** the bone is the most important part of the surgery.*

**Integrate into**&mdash;make something part of a larger whole:

> *They’re going to **integrate into** our building.*

***Integrate into*** can be a synonym of ***integrate in*** with the nuance that a smaller group becomes part of a larger whole

**Integrate with**&mdash;combine two similarly sized groups together:

> *I’d like to propose **integration with** the other political party.*

While *integrate in* and *integrate into* can be synonyms, ***integrate with*** cannot and specifically implies two groups merging together, rather than an entity merging into a larger group or adapting to the larger group.

While prepositions help clarify what exactly is being integrated in which situations, ***integrate*** can be used without a preposition:

> *They **integrated** the immigrants.*

*See also* [integrate \| merge](#integrate--merge)

## information about \| information of \| information on

**Information on** something would be information that is really in-depth, and quite into details. i.e. a study on history, or a book on biomedicine.

**Information about** something has the implication that it is information that is a kind of summary about a subject i.e. a brochure will contain *information about something*, but you can’t really say ~~*A brochure on mechanics.*~~ You would use *A brochure about mechanics.*

I would avoid using ***information of*** something for the reason that it could be misunderstood to mean *information belonging to something*.

[*Source*](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/32838/what-is-the-difference-between-information-on-information-of-information/32843)

***

## inform about \| inform of \| inform on

***Inform of*** merely talks about the information of something:

> *I’ll have to **inform** her **of** Joe’s kidnapping.*

**Inform about** means, not only will she be informed that Joe is kidnapped but also the details:

> *I’ll have to **inform** her **about** Joe’s kidnapping.*

**Inform on**&mdash;give incriminating information about someone to an authority:

> *John **informed on** the gang to the police.*

However, in the passive *inform on* merely indicates an area of coverage:

> *I am very **informed on** this matter.*

> *He is well **informed on** a wide variety of topics.*

***

## independent of \| ~~independently from~~ \| independently of

~~***Independently from***~~ is not correct usage, as well as being very uncommon. From X would indicate either coming from X or going away from X, neither of which applies here, since independence does not come or go from something.

***Independent*** is an adjective that defines a noun:

> *Something is **independent** of ...*

***Independently*** is an adverb that defines a verb:

> *You do something **independently** of ...*

The proper adverbial phrase is ***independently of***. The phrase ***independent of***, an adjective phrase, is sometimes WRONGLY asked to perform an adverbial function.

## in the photo \| in the picture \| on the postcard \| on the screen

If you are talking about the subject of the picture, use ***in***:

> *The boy **in** the picture is smiling.*

> *The boy **in** the photograph is walking on the sand.*

It seems simply wrong to talk about a person, or an object, ~~*on*~~ the photograph.

If you are talking about the picture as a piece of paper/canvas/etc., use ***on***:

> *Spilling water **on** the picture will ruin it.*

It would be different talking about a postcard, because the picture\/photograph is, itself, on the postcard. So if the photograph of the boy on the beach was printed as a postcard&mdash;or a greeting card of any kind&mdash;then he would be the boy on the card.

> *The boy **in** the photograph on the card.*

Photo takes precedence over paper. We always speak of things in the picture\/in the photo, regardless of the medium (paper, digital image, etc.) I would say ***on** the computer screen* because it is the medium for displaying an image.

> *The boy **in** the image on the computer screen.*

If that image had been painted on canvas (or on a wall):

> *The boy in the picture and **on** the canvas (**on** the wall).*

## hear about \| hear of

See [think of \| think about](#think-of--think-about).

You might say you’ve ***heard of*** something meaning no more than that you’re aware *something* exists. But if you’ve ***heard about*** *something* the implication is you’ve heard some important/current information about that thing.

> *I’ve **heard of** Amy Winehouse*. [\The name is known to me, but I don’t necessarily know any more.\]

> *I’ve **heard about** Amy Winehouse*. \[Strongly implies knowing of her untimely death.\]

## ~~for more detail~~ \| for more details \| in detail \| ~~in details~~ \| in more detail \| ~~in more details~~

> ***For more details** about the program, see the information packet.*

~~***In details***~~ is never correct as we’re not using the plural form of *detail* after *in*.

***In more detail*** looks at finding out about specifics for a topic. Generally, someone already has a good understanding of the basics.

> *Can you discuss this project with me **in more detail**?*

***In detail*** looks for a full and comprehensive explanation of something. Often, they will not already have any understanding of what’s going on.

> *I need you to explain, **in detail**, why you did those things.*

## except \| except for

***Except***&mdash;you are introducing the only thing, person, or group that your main statement does not apply to:

> *Anything, **except** water, is likely to block a sink.*

**Except for**&mdash;you are mentioning something that prevents a statement from being completely true:

> *The classroom was silent, **except for** the sound of pens on paper.*

***

## effort at \| effort in \| effort of \| effort to

effort\[s\] ***to*** {infinitive} is a more common form.

***effort at*** focuses on energy/resources that are required for the effort.

***effort in*** emphasizes that something requires certain energy/resources for the success.

One can say *trapping effort*, or *effort ***of*** trapping*, but the meaning is different than with the preposition *in* or *at*. In a noun-noun construct the first noun (the noun adjunct) serves the role of an adjective.

## die by \| die from \| die of

| Form | Interpretation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **die of** | Someone dies of a direct cause | *He **died of** cancer.* |
| **die from** | Someone dies from an indirect cause | *He **died from** smoking.* |
| **die by** | Someone dies by the means of something | *He **died by** a bullet.* |

If you fell twenty stories, we might say that you ***died from*** falling, but you ***died of*** massive trauma and bloodloss (caused by the fall).

Both *died of cancer* or *died from cancer* would probably be acceptable to an English speaker.

When someone ***dies by** the sword*, for example, we don’t literally mean that they died from a sword to the heart. Rather we mean that they were prone to violence, and themselves died violently.

You would more commonly see *death by X* as opposed to *died by X*:

> ***Death by** firing squad*

## designed for \| designed to

***design to***&mdash;this is used for what an object has been made to do itself:

> *Buildings can be **designed to** absorb and retain heat.*

> *The book is **designed for** learning English* (not ~~designed to learn~~, the book cannot learn English for itself)

## cover by \| cover in \| cover with

The meanings are very similar, and these three prepositions can be used almost interchangeably:

> *The mountain is **covered with/in/by** snow.*

When referring to a substance that sticks to another, use ***in*** or ***with***, but not ***by***:

> *The actress was **covered in** blood.*

> *The actress was **covered with** blood.*

> ~~*The actress was **covered by** blood.*~~

> *The ribs were **covered with** sauce.*

> *The ribs were **covered in** sauce.*

> ~~*The ribs were **covered by** sauce.*~~

When referring something that physically protects something else, use ***with*** or ***by***, but not ***in***:

> *The field was **covered with** a tarp.*

> *The field was **covered by** a tarp.*

> ~~*The field was **covered in** a tarp.*~~

Use ***covered with*** to indicate an unusual amount of something on top of something else; use ***covered by*** to connote a covering so dense that the object being covered is completely obscured from view:

> *The mountain was **covered with** fog.*

> *The mountain was **covered by** fog.*

> *Our grass was **covered with** butterflies.*

> *Our grass was **covered by** butterflies.*

When talking about metaphorical coverage, use ***covered by***:

> *The roof damage was **covered by** insurance.*

> ~~*The roof damage was **covered with** insurance.*~~

> ~~*The roof damage was **covered in** insurance.*~~

> *The city council meeting was **covered by** the news station.*

> ~~*The city council meeting was **covered with** the news station.*~~

## consist in \| consist of

**Consist of**&mdash;to be made up of, comprise:

> *This novel **consists of** three parts.*

**consist in**&mdash;to be essential, be inherent or lie in:

> *His social success **consists in** making people believe he is interested in what they say.*

The secret to a successful relationship consists in knowing that a crisis doesn’t mean everything is over.

Some people say a key point to know which one to use is that ***consist of*** is normally used with more tangible objects whereas ***consist in*** refers to an abstract quality.

Others also say that ***consist of*** is always followed by a noun phrase, whereas ***consist in*** is followed by a verb.

## considered \| considered as

***Considered as*** construction is almost always redundant. If you use ***considered*** to describe what people think of someone or something, you simply don’t need *as*.

> *LeBron James is **considered** one of the best basketball players of all time.*

> *Bad grammar should be **considered** a crime.*

## condition for \| condition of

The **conditions for** some state of affairs are the conditions that must exist in order for that state of affairs to exist:

> *The **conditions for** a hail storm.*

The **condition of** *something* is the state that it is in. This is a different definition of condition.

## communicate to \| communicate with

If you **communicate with** someone, you share or exchange information with them, for example by speaking, writing, or using equipment:

## check if \| check whether

***If*** and ***whether*** are often interchangeable, but sometimes using one or the other will change the meaning of your sentence.

> *We want to know **whether** you can come.*

> *Check his work and see **if** it is correct or not.*

> *Check his work and see **whether** it is correct or not.*

Use ***if*** when you have a conditional sentence and ***whether*** when showing that two alternatives are possible.

> *Squiggly didn’t know whether Aardvark would arrive Friday or Saturday.* \[There are two possibilities: Aardvark will arrive Friday, or Aardvark will arrive Saturday.\]

> *Squiggly didn’t know if Aardvark would arrive Friday or Saturday.* \[Aardvark may not arrive at all.\]

## by software \| by using software \| using software \| ~~via software~~ \| with software

| Example | Comment |
|---------|---------|
| ***by** software* | The software did all the work, without any human intervention. The work is actually done *by* a human with the help of the software. |
| ***by using** software* | Sounds correct and complete because you need both a preposition (*by*) and a verb (*use*). |
| ***with** software* | OK, but *using* is better&mdash;*with* doesn’t tell you what the person would be doing with the software (*using* it). |
| ***using*** | *Use* is a verb and thus indicates an action. |
| ~~***via** software*~~ | Sounds awkward in this context. *Via* is mostly used as a synonym of *by way of*, as in *I’m flying to Hawaii via California*. It can also be used to mean something is like a stepping-stone in a less literal sense, as in *She arrived at the answer via brainstorming.* *Via* would be used when you are talking about a path (literal or figurative) to somewhere with any number of “stops” on the way. In this context, the software is not like a stop on the way, but is the thing the person is using. |

## bound to \| bound with

***Bind to*** is used to describe the action of tying or attaching an object to another object:

> *Take the knife, and **bind** it **to** your leg.*

***Bind with*** is used to describe the thing which is used to tie or attach the object:

> *I will **bind** the knife with a rope.*

One is used with the object the action is performed upon, and the other is used with the object performing the action.

There is a range of idiomatic uses and similar phrasal verbs.

The outcome was inevitable. **To** might be seen as part of the infinitive to fail, certainly it needs to be followed by a verb in infinitive form:

> *He was **bound to** fail.*

A complex or ongoing relationship between the outcome (failure), and some other factor (his preconceptions):

> *His failure was **bound** up **with** his preconceptions.*

## at each step \| in each step \| on each step

***In each step***&mdash;something is done or happens as part of the process:

> *Assembling the furniture consists of seven steps. **In each step** a new piece is added to the assembly.*

***At each step***&mdash;something is done additionally to the process:

> *Creating a report takes three steps. **At each step** the author is required to check with a reviewer that it has been done correctly.*

***On*** turns the emphasis away from the person taking action, to emphasis the step as more crucial. *Step* could be a physical step (on a staircase or ladder) or a specific procedure one must do or follow:

> *While climbing the ladder to pick cherries, "Warning: Serious Injury May Occur if extended beyond 5 Meters" was written **on every step**.*

> *In building any model airplane with high voltage, safety equipment must be worn on every step, when performing steps 8 thru 14 below* [Whenever steps 8 thru 14 are performed, no matter which step it is between 8 and 14, safety equipment is necessary to prevent serious injury.)

## allow for \| allow of \| allow that \| allow to

**Allow** means:

- *permit* or *give permission*:

  > *I can’t **allow** you to go outside without a jacket.*

- fail to stop something from happening:
  
  > *The hermit **allowed** the grass to grow wild around the house and the
    yard.*

- admit (***allow that***[^allow_that]):
  
  > *The intern **allowed that** she was not the most experienced person to
    give the flu shots.*

**Allow for** means *make allowances for*[^make_allowances_for] or *consider
the possibility of something*.

[^allow_that]: allow that = допускать возможность того, что

[^make_allowances_for]: make allowances for = делать поправку на

> *The instructor **allowed for** the possibility that the students really did
  forget to bring their homework assignments to class.* = Although the
  instructor really believes that the students haven’t done the assignment, he
  is open to the possibility that they really did the work and just forgot to
  bring their assignments to class.

> *When we decided to go on a picnic, we didn’t **allow for** the chance that
  the rain would be as hard and continuous as it was.* = The friends didn’t
  consider the possibility that it would keep raining when they first made up
  their minds to go on a picnic.

**Allow of**[^allow_of] (permit) has never been common, and it has practically
disappeared today:

> *The evidence **allows of** the possibility of an inside job.*

[^allow_of]: Allow of = permit = делать возможным, допускать

We would not say that *the evidence ~~allows for~~ a possibility*, because
*evidence* is not a viable subject for that action; it is rather your
interpretation which must allow for possibilities.

## on the left \| to the left

***On the left*** should be used when referring to something or someone in the left direction:

> *I like the painting, but the tree **on the left** is not really finished compared to the rest of the scene.*

> *They turned through the gates **on the left** of the main road and walked into the park together.*

> *Look out of the window; **on your left**, you should be able to see the hotel clearly now.*

***To the left*** refers to a more specific location in a left direction and implies movement:

> *The road twisted abruptly **to the left**, and Martin had to slow down quickly to avoid a collision.*

> ***To the left** of the school is a small street of 10 houses and a post office.*

> *The switch for the TV is on the brown wooden table **to your left**.*

***

## useful for \| useful to

*This book is useful to me* indicates that it is useful and important to me&mdash;particularly to me not anybody else, whereas *This book is useful for me* indicates that it is useful for me in general sense. The book is useful for everyone because it is a good book and so it useful for me too but not particularly useful and important only to me.

## typical for = typical of

***

## translate into \| translate to

- When you speak about the target language of translation, the usual preposition is ***into***:

  > *She translated the text **into** German.*

- When pointing out that one phrase is a translation of another, i.e. when the target is a phrase rather than a language, ***to*** is used instead:

  > *“Good morning!” was translated **to** “Guten Morgen!”.*

- Both variants are common for the pattern *from a language (in)to another language*:

  > *She translated the text <ins>from</ins> English **into** German.*

  > *She translated the text <ins>from</ins> English **to** German.* (also possible)

While the variant with ***into*** is more common in English literature (and is also usually the the variant described in dictionaries and therefore the more recommendable variant for non-native speakers), the variant with ***to*** seems to be more common on the Internet and in everyday usage.

- Note that when “language to language” is used as an adjective phrase, the situation is reversed, and only ***to*** is common:

  > *We need to prepare an English-**to**-French translation.*

## time for \| time of \| time (required) for \| time (required) to

*The **time of** the exam* will usually mean *the time appointed for the exam to start*:

> *The **time of** the exam is 2:00 pm.*

*The **time for** the exam* means one of the following:

- the time appointed for the exam to start;
- the time allotted for the exam to last;
- the time actually spent on the exam.

To eliminate ambiguity, use *The time allotted for* or *The time allowed for*.

~~*The required time of/for assembling*~~ is at best poor style. Much better is *the **time required to** assemble/**for** assembling*.

***time to***: *time to + \<infinitive\>*

***time for***: *time for + \<gerund\> (..-ing)*

***

## throw at \| throw to

**Throw at**&mdash;to throw something so that it HITS the target.

**Throw to** can mean two things:

1. If throwing to a person, it is usually so that they can catch the object.
1. If throwing to something else, it is so that the object ends up near the target.

[*Source*](https://hinative.com/ru/questions/209548)

***

## think about \| think of

In many contexts, ***think of*** and ***think about*** are effectively interchangeable.

> *I’m **thinking of\/about** looking for a new job.*

In other contexts, to **think of** something means you’re at least aware of the thing, but may not have given it a great deal of consideration. If you ***think about*** something this normally implies more focused or extended attention.

> *I never **thought of** doing that!* \[That possibility never crossed my mind.\]

> *Have you **thought about** my birthday present?* \[Have you considered\/decided what to get me?\]

> *He **suggested going** to Glastonbury.*

> *He **suggested my going** to Glastonbury.*

> *I **suggested visiting** your grandmother.*

## statistics about \| statistics on

> *statistics **on/about** the suicide rate*

***statistics on***&mdash;direct suicide rate statistics&mdash;deaths per year, per age group, etc.

***statistics about***&mdash;the direct statistics \+ statistics which are related in some way (number of divorces, reported happiness levels).

[*Source*](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/statistics-on-about.3085846/#post-15602853)

***

## starting from \| starting with

***Starting with*** A includes only words that start with the letter A.

> *Please give me all the names **starting with** A.*

***Starting from*** A gives you all the words that start with A and all the words that start with the letters after A.

> *Let’s start cutting back on our expenses, **starting with/from** the money we spend on food.*

They can be used interchangeably if there is no order to what is being started with\/from, though ***with*** is more correct in my opinion. When order matters, ***starting from*** includes all items starting with and coming after.

***

## solution for \| solution of \| solution to

Generally we use ***to***:

> *We have the **solution to** all your problems.*

You can use ***solutions for*** when speaking of the recipient of the solution, as opposed to linking a solution to a problem:

> *We have **solutions for** your family in your time of need.*

It depends on your use of the word *solution*:

> *What’s the **solution to** the problem?* (The answer to the problem)

> *He won £10,000 for the **solution of** the math problem.* (The solving of the problem)

In chemistry:

> *A **solution of** hydrogen peroxide and one of saturated potassium iodide.*

***

## separated by \| separated with

***By*** marks an agent phrase:

> *The fighters were finally **separated by** the referee.*

***With*** marks an instrumental phrase:

> *The fighters were finally **separated with** a crowbar.*

When you’re talking about metaphoric separation you have the option of treating the *separator* either as an agent itself, or as a tool (of another agent).

The agent interpretation:

> *The entries are **separated by** commas.*

The instrument interpretation:

> *The entries were **separated with** commas.*

*A typewriter* is an instrument, but *a ghostwriter* is a human, and therefore an agent.

In most cases ***by*** and ***with*** are interchangeable, yet it could vary in cases like:

> *I **smell with** my nose.*

> ~~*I smell by my nose.*~~

One of the interchangeable cases is:

> *This is **indicated by** a green light*.

> *This is **indicated with** a green light*.

If you are writing documentation for your application, use the correct word for readability:

> *This should be **instantiated by** passing the arguments A, B and C.*

> *They should be **separated by** a comma.*

> *This should be **called with** D and E.*

## run in Windows \| run on Windows \| run under Windows

![run_on_windows.svg](../../resources/charts/run_on_windows.svg)

![run_on_under_windows_coca.svg](../../resources/charts/run_on_under_windows_coca.svg) ![../../run_on_under_windows_bnc.svg](../../resources/charts/run_on_under_windows_bnc.svg)

Originally operating systems would be seen roughly like a set of rules, in which case you ***run under*** a set of rules. Nowadays an operating system is seen as a basis for building things upon, like a foundation, in which case you ***run on*** a foundation. Both are valid.

As generic word usage, you would say *on a platform*, not *in a platform*. Saying that the program ***runs in** Linux* calls up the idea of using Linux as a container or environment. This is not wrong, but it’s less common.

> *A machine is **running** a certain operating system.*

> *A program is **running on** a certain operating system.*

## restriction of \| restriction on

***Restriction on*** relates to what person or thing is restricted:

> *Since his release from jail, the only **restriction on** Joe is his requirement to see his parole officer every Tuesday at 8 a.m.*

***Restriction of*** relates to the kind of restriction involved:

> ***Restriction of** voting rights based on race is unconstitutional.*

When both the object and type of restriction are involved, either preposition is acceptable:

> *Now that Joe is no longer on parole, only the **restriction on** his voting rights remains* \[draws attention to the fact that Joe is still subject to restrictions\]

> *Now that Joe is no longer on parole, only the **restriction of** his voting rights remains* \[draws attention to the kind of restrictions that Joe is still subject to\]

## requirement for \| requirement of \| requirement on \| requirement to

***Requirement on*** a person or something that is required to do something:

> *The second element is a new **requirement on** private landlords to check tenants’ immigration status.*

> *The **requirement on** the ECB[^ecb] is to keep inflation below but close to 2 per cent.*

[^ecb]: ECB = European Central Bank

***Requirement of*** a person or something that has required someone to do something:

> *Such a declaration is a **requirement of** the law.*

> *Pain tolerance is an essential **requirement of** his profession.*

***Requirement for*** something that is required:

> *Water is a fundamental **requirement for** life.*

> *The **requirements for** the training course are stringent.*

In ***requirement to*** *to* is attached to the verb as an infinitive:

> *Stella strongly feels the **requirement to** do so, I think.*

> *The current **requirement to** disclose portfolio information semiannually remains appropriate.*

## replace by \| replace with

If you are referring to replacing something that is broken, old, or not working\/inoperative, then you ***replace*** it ***with*** a new one.

If you are referring to filling the role of someone or something with a substitute, then it is ***replaced by***.

> *Human bank tellers have all but been **replaced by** ATMs.*

> *Adam was **replaced by** Bill* (Bill decided that Adam had to be replaced, but the sentence doesn’t say who Bill picked to replace Adam).

***

## react on \| react to

We ***react to*** a stimulus or situation:

> *The dog **reacted to** the bell by salivating.*

***React on***[^react_on] can refer to something which is affected:

> *These chemicals **react on** plastics.*

From a grammatical perspective, the plastics are not the stimulus. There is a reaction when the chemicals are applied to plastics.

[^react_on]: влиять на (кого-либо, что-либо); реагировать на

***

## provide \| provide for \| provide with

***Provide***: the result/outcome is the direct object:

> *A house **provides** shelter.*

> *My job **provides** income.* \[My job provides me with income.\]

***Provide with*:** *provide* is followed by an indirect object. **Providing** (someone) **with** something means to give something wanted or needed:

> *Room to Read **provides** girls **with** scholarships that cover the cost of housing, food, and books.*

> ***Provide** the Partner **with** explanations on matters, arising in connection with execution of this Agreement.*

In this sentence, *girls* is the indirect object and *scholarships* is the direct object.

**Provide for**, in general, means to make whatever is necessary for someone available to him or her. We often use this expression when we talk about parents providing for their family:

> *She says changes such as migration away from rural areas are allowing more women to find work and **provide for** their families.*

**Provide for** can mean *prepare for*:

> *The architect **provided for** the possibility of storms by strengthening the abutments.*

> ~~*The architect **provided** the possibility of storms by strengthening the abutments*.~~ \[Stronger abutments are somehow supposed to invoke storms.\]

## outside \| outside of

***Outside of***:

- not recommended for formal writing;
- tends to be more commonly used in the US than in Britain;
- often used as a colloquial way of saying *except for*, *other than*, *apart from*:

> ***Outside of** what I just mentioned, I can’t think of any reason not to.*

***

## opposite \| opposite to

- As a noun, ***opposite*** may stand alone or be followed by the preposition *of*:

  > *Madeleine believes just the **opposite**!*

  > *What is the **opposite** of up?*

- As an adjective, ***opposite*** may stand alone or be followed by the preposition to *or* occasionally *from*:

  > *The cars were travelling in **opposite** directions when the accident occurred.*

  > *Hyacinth’s opinions are often **opposite** to Pierre’s.*

  > *Keith’s cottage is on the same lake but on the **opposite** side from (or to) ours.*

- ***Opposite*** may also function as a preposition. The preposition ***opposite*** should not be followed by *of* or *to*:

  > *Jean-Luc lives in the house **opposite** ours.*

  > *Two dozen condos will be built **opposite** the theatre* (not ~~*opposite of the theatre*~~ or ~~*opposite to the theatre*~~).

## on \| onto

We use **onto** to:

- Talk about direction or movement to a position on a surface, usually with a verb that expresses movement:

  > *The cat climbed **onto** the roof.*

  > *She emptied the suitcase full of clothes **onto** the floor.*

- Describe movement towards an end position along a road or river:

  > *The path leads **onto** the main road.*

We use ***on*** or ***onto*** with very little difference in meaning to refer to attachment or movement of something to something else. ***Onto*** gives a stronger feeling of movement:

> *There's a battery pack with the camera that you can clip **onto** a belt.*

> *You can save the data **onto** your hard disk.*

> *Have you put the pictures **on** your memory stick?*

## notify about \| notify of \| ~~notify on~~

***Notify about*** = ***notify of*** (although *some* native speakers think that *of* sounds better):

> *Please **notify <ins>us</ins> of** any change of address* \[at least *someone* is required\]

| Pattern                      | Example                                                                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| notify somebody              | *Competition winners will be **notified** by post.*                              |
|                              | *You must **notify** us in writing if you wish to cancel your subscription.*     |
| notify somebody of something | *The police must be **notified of** the date of the demonstration.*              |
| notify something to somebody | *The date of the demonstration must be **notified** to the police.*              |
| notify somebody that         | *Members have been **notified that** there will be a small increase in the fee.* |

***Notify on*** has another meaning:

> *After a few minutes I get a **notification on** my iPhone, you can continue the journey!*

> *But I got a push **notification on** my Redbox app.*

> *Does the Member State submit a non confidential version of the **notification on** a voluntary basis?*

## mount at \| mount in \| mount on \| ~~mount to~~

Levin (English Verb Classes and Alternations) places *mount* under “Verbs of Putting”, and specifically says that the preposition ***to*** is wrong for such verbs. She lists some “Verbs of Combining and Attaching” which take the preposition *to* (*add*, *connect*, *join*, *link*), but does not include *mount* among them.

Other uses:

> *In the same year the entartete Kunst exhibition was **mounted in** Munich.*

> *The Party bitterly opposed the conspiracy theory that Evatt **mounted at** the Petrov Royal Commission.*

> *Residents suggest the deployment of an army unit to curb constant attacks **mounted by** the Somali Bandits in the area.*

> *These towers were manned day and night and were **mounted with**[^mount_with] a machine gun, rifle and searchlight.*

[^mount_with]: mount with = оборудовать, оснащать

> *Demands are **mounting for** a high-powered investigation with Liberal shadow minister Senator David Johnston today warning sex abuse claims were harming the reputation of the Catholic Church.*

## miss from \| miss in

**miss in**&mdash;something or somebody is lost within something. You suppose that their existence is true, but their temporal or spatial position is missing:

> ***Missing in** action*

> *What’s **missing in** your apartment?*

**Miss from**&mdash;something is lost entirely from its source, and whether or not it was there to begin with is irrelevant.

> *Copy of check is **missing from** the file*

~~Missing in the file~~ doesn’t make sense because it’s *not* in the file. The only use I can think of for ***missing in*** is when something (or someone) goes missing:

> *John went **missing in** Paris.*

> *I **missed** that new car **in** the first version of this computer game so much.* \[You obtained the first version of the game after you had already played version two. You regret going back to an older version.\]

> *I **missed** that new car **from** the first version of this computer game so much.* \[The car was in the first version but was absent from the second version.\]

You can’t really miss something until you have it. You don’t say to a girl you just met, *I’ve missed you all my life.* After you know her, and she goes away, then you can miss her:

> *I **missed** you while you were on vacation.*

## made from \| made of

**Made of** is used when the material the subject consists of doesn’t change during the process of making the subject.

> *Chairs are **made of** wood.*

Here, wood is still wood. It doesn’t transform into something else.

On the other hand, **made from** is used when the material changed its nature.

> *Paper is **made from** wood.*

Now, wood disappeared&mdash;it was transformed into paper.

Some more examples:

> *The house is **made of** bricks.* \[They are still bricks.\]

> *Wine is **made from** grapes.* \[Grapes turn into wine.\]

> *I have a table and it’s **made from** bamboo.*

The carpenter took stocks of bamboo, cut them, halved them, and made them into a table. The carpenter **modified** the bamboo’s **structural integrity**, so my table is **made from** bamboo.

> *I have a vase and it’s made of bamboo.*

The carpenter took a stock of bamboo and carved a vase out of it. The carpenter **didn’t modify** the bamboo’s **structural integrity**, so my vase is **made of** bamboo.

## ~~log in to~~ \| log into \| ~~login to~~ \| log on

It should go without saying that *into* is a single word. It’s a preposition that expresses movement towards something else:

> *I went into the building* (not ~~*went in to*~~ = I went in (somewhere) to do an activity called “the building”)

> *I went in to drink* (not ~~*went into*~~ = I went into a place called “drink”)

***Login*** can be either a noun or adjective, therefore should not be followed by *to*.

When you ***log on*** to something, you are simply accessing digital material, without necessarily needing to provide credentials:

> ***Log on** to the news website of your choice and choose an article to discuss in class next week.*

A *login* usually requires credentials.

## knowledge about \| knowledge of \| ~~knowledge on~~

> *I would want to increase my **knowledge of** writers.*

Know science, know music:

## interfere in \| interfere with

In the case of someone else's life, you can either ***interfere in*** or **with**. The former is critical of the fact that you meddled at all. The latter is critical of the results of your meddling.

To **interfere with** means to disrupt:

> *Wave patterns can **interfere with** each other* \[they are mutually disruptive\]

Whilst it’s true that ***interfering in*** someone else’s affairs may be disruptive, it needn’t be. But if you ***interfere with*** their affairs, you’re definitely having a bad influence. There’s also the idiomatic usage of a paedophile ***interfering with*** a victim, which normally refers specifically to touching a child’s genitals.

## integrate \| integrate in \| integrate into \| ~~integrate to~~ \| integrate with

**Integrate in**&mdash;combine many things into a whole:

> *We have **integrated in** companies many times.*

> *The **integration in** the bone is the most important part of the surgery.*

**Integrate into**&mdash;make something part of a larger whole:

> *They’re going to **integrate into** our building.*

***Integrate into*** can be a synonym of ***integrate in*** with the nuance that a smaller group becomes part of a larger whole

**Integrate with**&mdash;combine two similarly sized groups together:

> *I’d like to propose **integration with** the other political party.*

While *integrate in* and *integrate into* can be synonyms, ***integrate with*** cannot and specifically implies two groups merging together, rather than an entity merging into a larger group or adapting to the larger group.

While prepositions help clarify what exactly is being integrated in which situations, ***integrate*** can be used without a preposition:

> *They **integrated** the immigrants.*

## information about \| information of \| information on

**Information on** something would be information that is really in-depth, and quite into details. i.e. a study on history, or a book on biomedicine.

**Information about** something has the implication that it is information that is a kind of summary about a subject i.e. a brochure will contain *information about something*, but you can’t really say ~~*A brochure on mechanics.*~~ You would use *A brochure about mechanics.*

I would avoid using ***information of*** something for the reason that it could be misunderstood to mean *information belonging to something*.

## inform about \| inform of \| inform on

***Inform of*** merely talks about the information of something:

> *I’ll have to **inform** her **of** Joe’s kidnapping.*

**Inform about** means, not only will she be informed that Joe is kidnapped but also the details:

> *I’ll have to **inform** her **about** Joe’s kidnapping.*

**Inform on**&mdash;give incriminating information about someone to an authority:

> *John **informed on** the gang to the police.*

However, in the passive *inform on* merely indicates an area of coverage:

> *I am very **informed on** this matter.*

> *He is well **informed on** a wide variety of topics.*

## independent of \| ~~independently from~~ \| independently of

~~***Independently from***~~ is not correct usage, as well as being very uncommon. From X would indicate either coming from X or going away from X, neither of which applies here, since independence does not come or go from something.

***Independent*** is an adjective that defines a noun:

> *Something is **independent** of ...*

***Independently*** is an adverb that defines a verb:

> *You do something **independently** of ...*

The proper adverbial phrase is ***independently of***. The phrase ***independent of***, an adjective phrase, is sometimes WRONGLY asked to perform an adverbial function.

## in the photo \| in the picture \| on the postcard \| on the screen

If you are talking about the subject of the picture, use ***in***:

> *The boy **in** the picture is smiling.*

> *The boy **in** the photograph is walking on the sand.*

It seems simply wrong to talk about a person, or an object, ~~*on*~~ the photograph.

If you are talking about the picture as a piece of paper/canvas/etc., use ***on***:

> *Spilling water **on** the picture will ruin it.*

It would be different talking about a postcard, because the picture\/photograph is, itself, on the postcard. So if the photograph of the boy on the beach was printed as a postcard&mdash;or a greeting card of any kind&mdash;then he would be the boy on the card.

> *The boy **in** the photograph on the card.*

Photo takes precedence over paper. We always speak of things in the picture\/in the photo, regardless of the medium (paper, digital image, etc.) I would say ***on** the computer screen* because it is the medium for displaying an image.

> *The boy **in** the image on the computer screen.*

If that image had been painted on canvas (or on a wall):

> *The boy in the picture and **on** the canvas (**on** the wall).*

## hear about \| hear of

See [think of \| think about](#think-of--think-about).

You might say you’ve ***heard of*** something meaning no more than that you’re aware *something* exists. But if you’ve ***heard about*** *something* the implication is you’ve heard some important/current information about that thing.

> *I’ve **heard of** Amy Winehouse*. [\The name is known to me, but I don’t necessarily know any more.\]

> *I’ve **heard about** Amy Winehouse*. \[Strongly implies knowing of her untimely death.\]

## ~~for more detail~~ \| for more details \| in detail \| ~~in details~~ \| in more detail \| ~~in more details~~

***In more detail*** looks at finding out about specifics for a topic. Generally, someone already has a good understanding of the basics.

> *Can you discuss this project with me **in more detail**?*

***In detail*** looks for a full and comprehensive explanation of something. Often, they will not already have any understanding of what’s going on.

## effort at \| effort in \| effort of \| effort to

effort\[s\] ***to*** {infinitive} is a more common form.

***effort at*** focuses on energy/resources that are required for the effort.

***effort in*** emphasizes that something requires certain energy/resources for the success.

One can say *trapping effort*, or *effort ***of*** trapping*, but the meaning is different than with the preposition *in* or *at*. In a noun-noun construct the first noun (the noun adjunct) serves the role of an adjective.

## die by \| die from \| die of

| Form | Interpretation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **die of** | Someone dies of a direct cause | *He **died of** cancer.* |
| **die from** | Someone dies from an indirect cause | *He **died from** smoking.* |
| **die by** | Someone dies by the means of something | *He **died by** a bullet.* |

If you fell twenty stories, we might say that you ***died from*** falling, but you ***died of*** massive trauma and bloodloss (caused by the fall).

Both *died of cancer* or *died from cancer* would probably be acceptable to an English speaker.

When someone ***dies by** the sword*, for example, we don’t literally mean that they died from a sword to the heart. Rather we mean that they were prone to violence, and themselves died violently.

You would more commonly see *death by X* as opposed to *died by X*:

## cover by \| cover in \| cover with

The meanings are very similar, and these three prepositions can be used almost interchangeably:

> *The mountain is **covered with/in/by** snow.*

When referring to a substance that sticks to another, use ***in*** or ***with***, but not ***by***:

> *The actress was **covered in** blood.*

> *The actress was **covered with** blood.*

> ~~*The actress was **covered by** blood.*~~

> *The ribs were **covered with** sauce.*

> *The ribs were **covered in** sauce.*

> ~~*The ribs were **covered by** sauce.*~~

When referring something that physically protects something else, use ***with*** or ***by***, but not ***in***:

> *The field was **covered with** a tarp.*

> *The field was **covered by** a tarp.*

> ~~*The field was **covered in** a tarp.*~~

Use ***covered with*** to indicate an unusual amount of something on top of something else; use ***covered by*** to connote a covering so dense that the object being covered is completely obscured from view:

> *The mountain was **covered with** fog.*

> *The mountain was **covered by** fog.*

> *Our grass was **covered with** butterflies.*

> *Our grass was **covered by** butterflies.*

When talking about metaphorical coverage, use ***covered by***:

> *The roof damage was **covered by** insurance.*

> ~~*The roof damage was **covered with** insurance.*~~

> ~~*The roof damage was **covered in** insurance.*~~

> *The city council meeting was **covered by** the news station.*

## consist in \| consist of

**consist in**&mdash;to be essential, be inherent or lie in:

> *His social success **consists in** making people believe he is interested in what they say.*

The secret to a successful relationship consists in knowing that a crisis doesn’t mean everything is over.

Some people say a key point to know which one to use is that ***consist of*** is normally used with more tangible objects whereas ***consist in*** refers to an abstract quality.

Others also say that ***consist of*** is always followed by a noun phrase, whereas ***consist in*** is followed by a verb.

> *Check his work and see **if** it is correct or not.*

> *Check his work and see **whether** it is correct or not.*

| ***with** software* | OK, but *using* is better&mdash;*with* doesn’t tell you what the person would be doing with the software (*using* it). |
| ***using*** | *Use* is a verb and thus indicates an action. |
| ~~***via** software*~~ | Sounds awkward in this context. *Via* is mostly used as a synonym of *by way of*, as in *I’m flying to Hawaii via California*. It can also be used to mean something is like a stepping-stone in a less literal sense, as in *She arrived at the answer via brainstorming.* *Via* would be used when you are talking about a path (literal or figurative) to somewhere with any number of “stops” on the way. In this context, the software is not like a stop on the way, but is the thing the person is using. |

***Bind with*** is used to describe the thing which is used to tie or attach the object:

One is used with the object the action is performed upon, and the other is used with the object performing the action.

There is a range of idiomatic uses and similar phrasal verbs.

The outcome was inevitable. **To** might be seen as part of the infinitive to fail, certainly it needs to be followed by a verb in infinitive form:

A complex or ongoing relationship between the outcome (failure), and some other factor (his preconceptions):

## at each step \| in each step \| on each step

***In each step***&mdash;something is done or happens as part of the process:

> *Assembling the furniture consists of seven steps. **In each step** a new piece is added to the assembly.*

***At each step***&mdash;something is done additionally to the process:

> *Creating a report takes three steps. **At each step** the author is required to check with a reviewer that it has been done correctly.*

***On*** turns the emphasis away from the person taking action, to emphasis the step as more crucial. *Step* could be a physical step (on a staircase or ladder) or a specific procedure one must do or follow:

> *While climbing the ladder to pick cherries, "Warning: Serious Injury May Occur if extended beyond 5 Meters" was written **on every step**.*

> *In building any model airplane with high voltage, safety equipment must be worn on every step, when performing steps 8 thru 14 below* [Whenever steps 8 thru 14 are performed, no matter which step it is between 8 and 14, safety equipment is necessary to prevent serious injury.)

## allow for \| allow of \| allow that \| allow to

**Allow** means:

- *permit* or *give permission*:

  > *I can’t **allow** you to go outside without a jacket.*

- fail to stop something from happening:
  
  > *The hermit **allowed** the grass to grow wild around the house and the
    yard.*

- admit (***allow that***[^allow_that]):
  
  > *The intern **allowed that** she was not the most experienced person to
    give the flu shots.*

**Allow for** means *make allowances for*[^make_allowances_for] or *consider
the possibility of something*.

[^allow_that]: allow that = допускать возможность того, что

[^make_allowances_for]: make allowances for = делать поправку на

> *The instructor **allowed for** the possibility that the students really did
  forget to bring their homework assignments to class.* = Although the
  instructor really believes that the students haven’t done the assignment, he
  is open to the possibility that they really did the work and just forgot to
  bring their assignments to class.

> *When we decided to go on a picnic, we didn’t **allow for** the chance that
  the rain would be as hard and continuous as it was.* = The friends didn’t
  consider the possibility that it would keep raining when they first made up
  their minds to go on a picnic.

**Allow of**[^allow_of] (permit) has never been common, and it has practically
disappeared today:

> *The evidence **allows of** the possibility of an inside job.*

[^allow_of]: Allow of = permit = делать возможным, допускать

We would not say that *the evidence ~~allows for~~ a possibility*, because
*evidence* is not a viable subject for that action; it is rather your
interpretation which must allow for possibilities.

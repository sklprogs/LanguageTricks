## allow for \| allow of \| allow that \| allow to

**Allow** means:

- *permit* or *give permission*:

  > *I can’t **allow** you to go outside without a jacket.*

- fail to stop something from happening:
  
  > *The hermit **allowed** the grass to grow wild around the house and the
    yard.*

- admit (***allow that***[^allow_that]):
  
  > *The intern **allowed that** she was not the most experienced person to
    give the flu shots.*

**Allow for** means *make allowances for*[^make_allowances_for] or *consider
the possibility of something*.

[^allow_that]: allow that = допускать возможность того, что

[^make_allowances_for]: make allowances for = делать поправку на

> *The instructor **allowed for** the possibility that the students really did
  forget to bring their homework assignments to class.* = Although the
  instructor really believes that the students haven’t done the assignment, he
  is open to the possibility that they really did the work and just forgot to
  bring their assignments to class.

> *When we decided to go on a picnic, we didn’t **allow for** the chance that
  the rain would be as hard and continuous as it was.* = The friends didn’t
  consider the possibility that it would keep raining when they first made up
  their minds to go on a picnic.

**Allow of**[^allow_of] (permit) has never been common, and it has practically
disappeared today:

> *The evidence **allows of** the possibility of an inside job.*

[^allow_of]: Allow of = permit = делать возможным, допускать

We would not say that *the evidence ~~allows for~~ a possibility*, because
*evidence* is not a viable subject for that action; it is rather your
interpretation which must allow for possibilities.

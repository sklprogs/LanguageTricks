# Formatting Punctuation Marks in English

## Italicizing Comma After an Italic Word

If the commas are not logically part of the italicized material, they should not be italicized.

> We rented the movie *Planes, Trains and Automobiles*. \[The comma is part of the title\]

## Punctuation Mark and a Word Before

The formatting of the punctuation mark should match the formatting of the word before, but there can be exceptions:

> The difference is statistically significant (*p* < .05).

## Colon at the End of a Heading

Do not underline the colon at the end of a heading.
